26 and a 5 uc He divided it into three provinces-Tarraconensis or

Hispania Citerior, Baetica or Hispania Ulterior, and Lusitania The
two last had formed originally one province, but were separated either
at this date or by Tiberius.

(r) Tarraconensis was at once the largest in extent and the most
important of the three. 7Ιῑ comprised not only the whole of the north-
east district and the route to Italy, but also the warlike and disturbed
cantons of the North and North-west, which it had eost Augustus
several campaigns to subdue, and which long remained a source of
danger and anxiety to successive govemors¹ To overawe this region a
permanent force of two or even three legions was considered neces
sary. In the year 68 ab, when Galba was proclaimed emperor, the
force quartered in the province consisted of the oth and the roth
legions Of these the 6th accompanied the newlyaccepted emperor on
his march to Rome; but as we have no mention of the roth, it seems
reasonable to conclude that this legion was then left behind, and it
only quitted Spain when called out at length to assist in the suppression
of the revolt of Civilis (iv. 68, v. ao). Galba seems to have hesitated
to take it with him lest he should denude the country entirely of
troops, and so leave. it exposed to the attacks of the warlike mountain
tribes (ewen at that day very imperfectly schooled to bear the Roman
yohe). 'l’he apprehensions entertained on this score are further ,
evidenced by the fact that >Vitellius after the battle of Bedriacum
despatched at once the 1st Adjutrix to increase the garrison of the
country, and that in Vespasian's time it was still thought necessary to
keep up a force of three full legions in the Peninsula The capital of
the province had been originally Carthago Nova, but Augustus trans·
ferred it to Tarraco or Colonia Tarraconensis, situated on the sea·
consta little north of the Ebro. His reason for making the change
was partly to bring the capital nearer to Rome, but still more in order
to shift his base of operations nearer to the tribes of the North and
North-west from whom danger was chiefly to be apprehended. The
great road which was at the same time made through Spain, to which
was given the name of the Via Augusta, connected Tarraco with Italy
and the North on one side, on the other it ran along the seacoast,
passing through the towns with which this was studded, to the mouth
of the river Jucar a little south of Valentia; at this point it turned
sharply inland, crossed the Baetis at the Arch of Augustus, from which
the-roads through Baetica were measured, and then followed the course
of this river till it reached the Atlantic Ocean at Gades ,By it,
continuing as it did the great coast road through Southern Gaul, Rome
was brought into direct communication with the Atlantic Ocean. In
the Tarraconensis other roads were made for military purposes in the
direction of the North-West, and it was by their means, together with
the standing military camps which were established at Astorga and
elsewhere, that the tribes of Asturia and Callaecia were gradually

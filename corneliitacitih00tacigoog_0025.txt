6 THE HISTORIES OF TA CITUS sacr.

tations ol the more difficolt passages show always an independent and

a sound judgnrent His worlr is thoroughly good and satisfactory,
leaving indeed little to be desired As an emender ol the text he is
somewhat more advenhuous than Orelli, holding indeed a middle
place between him and Ritter. 1 have been led in most instances ⁸
myseli to preler the more ‘conservative reading, but Heraeus’s suggestions
are scarcely ever without ingenuity or without authority from the other
writings ol Tacitus.

Tacitus, so iar as we know, composed only five literary worlrs, via
the Dialogus de chris armodius, the De uita et martias Jalii Agn'calae
liber, the Germania, the· Histoi-rias, the Annali, or to describe it by
the title which Tacitus himself seems to have given to it, Ab excessa
Divi Augusti. ln addition to these live worlrs we know that he
contemplated at least two others One was an account of the reigns
oi Nerva and Trajan, a work which he says (H. i. ι) he had set apart
lor his old age; the other a history oi the reign ol Augustus, intended
as a supplement or introduction to the Annals (Ann iii. 24). Neither
ol these projected works did he live to execute3 his untimely death
put a stop to them both.
¹ Ol the five worlrs which he lived to complete, all oi which, though
not in their entirety, have come down to us, the Dralagm holds a
place apert. It was written in Tacitus’s youth, probably when he was ·
not more than twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, at the end oi the
reign oi Titus or the beginning ol that ol Domitian (see e 17, where
the dialogue itsell, which Tacitus represents himself as relating, is placed
in the sixth year ol the reign oi Vespasian). Its immediate object
wasto prove and to account lor the decay ol eloquence during the
imperial period, an object he attempts to carry out. by means ol au
imaginary dialogue between literary and oratorical celebrities living
in the time ol Vespasian Indirectly it was, perhaps, composed with
a personal object-to state the reasons which induced Tacitus himself,
in spite ol his extensive rhetorical studies and the lamehe had acquired
in the art, to devote himself to literary and historical pursuits. Whetber =
this was the object ol the Dialogus or notitia certain that be did
about this time finally abandon oratory, and devote himself to those
historieal studies with which his name has continued hencelorth indis
solubly associated .

All his four remaining works are most intimately connected with
one another, the Historias being the centre ol the whole group.. The
Agn'cola and the Germany may both ol them be regarded as pre-
liminary studies ior the Historia, while the Annals are a lrind oi
appendix to the earlier work, designed to show how the condition
ol things slretched in the Historiis had gradually grown up, and also

curing his removal. The news of his death reached Rome shortly
before Galba's arrival in the city (i 7, 73). On Otho's accession

Africa, at the instigation of Crescenaa freedman of Nero, welcomed
the proclamation of the new emperorand held high feast in his honour
(i. 76). Otho in gratitude granted it, along with Cappadocia, a new
code of laws (i 78). Vipstanus Apronianus was at this time proconsul,
but he had only civil not military authority. There was stationed in
the country a single legion (the 3d Augusta), and certain cohorts which
Macer had enrolled and which he had, perhaps, invested with the form
ofa legion; inscriptions in Africa testify at least to the existence of a
legio Macriano. These latter at the time of Macer’s overthrow were
disbanded 1)) Galba but recalled by Vitellius, to whom both troops and
provincials were alike favourable as he bad been liked and popular
during his administration of the province Valerius Festus, imperial
procurator, legate of the legion, and commender of the troops, himself
a relation of Vitellius, played alter the battle of Bedriacum a double
part Openly he supported the cause of Vitellius; in secret he carried
on communications with Vespasian (ii 98).' At a later date, when
fortune had declared for the Flavians, be hesitated no more. He
first tried to corrupt 1. Piso, who had succeeded Vipstanus Apron·
ianus as proconsul, and to induce him to declare himself openly ior
Vitellius. This Piso refused to do, though the aeal of the Africana in
the cause of Vitellius was notorious. When this attempt failed a cen·
turion was despatched from Rome by Mucianus to kill him, and
treacherously incited the people to proclaim Piso himself emperor.
Piso, warned by an earlier messenger of what was intended, lrept him-
self shut up in his house, refused to accept the acclamations of the
populace, and gave orders for the execution of the centurion who had
been sent to murder him. Festus, however, was not to bc balked3
he despatched Carthaginian and Moorish auxiliaries into the palace
charged with Piso's murder. These, guided by Baebius Massa, afterwards
a celebrated informer under Domitian, succeeded in discovering and
slaying the unfortunate proconsul Festus, who had waited the event
at Adrumetum, hastened at once to the legion, put to death any of the
officers hostile to himself or friendly to Piso, and succeeded in this way
in overawing the troops Then he employed them in repressing one
of those border quarrels so frequent at all times in Africa Α war had '
sprung up between the people of Oea, in the eastern part of the pro·
vince, and Leptis Major. The former, to compensate for their own
want of strength, had called in the nomad tribe of Garamantes to their
assistance. The Garamantes had joined them nothing loth, and had·
amassed considerable booty at the expense of the people of Leptis.
Most of this Festus and his troops managed to recover. More im-
portant, however, was the fact that his action had gained the province

for Vespasian and had saved Rome from any chance of being starved
under its new rulers (iv. 48-50). ·

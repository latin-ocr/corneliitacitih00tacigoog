notes oi vulne, but is overladen by the amount ol the material he has
thought it necessary to introduce. It is singular that while the English
translations ol the Hr'stotr'cs have been so many—and Messrs Church
and Brodribb have in our own days added another excellent one to
their number-so little has been done by English scholars lor the
emendation or the elucidation ol the text

lt remains to mention iour editions ol foreign scholars, all note·
worthy in different ways, to the three last of which the present editor
isunder the greatest possible obligation. Ernesti in his edition, pub
lished at Leipzig in 1752, condensed the notes ol Lipsius and Gronovius,
and added besides others os his own. Ruperti’s edition, published at
Hanover in 1834-1839‚ besides having a careiul digestos the readings,
is tull oi learning, and illustrates Tacitus admirably, particularly on
the historioal side His introduction contains a very careiul review
alike oi the MS. authorities and oi the various editions of our author.
Ritter’s edition, published in Cambridge and london in 1848, witha
rewised text and notes critical and exegetical, is in many respecta a
work of real genius. His text is unfortunately too often distigured
by the undue license in coniectural emendation which he bas allowed
himself. The notes, though always ingenious and showing tolens'ol
wide reading, display sometimes a tendency to prefers strained and
iar-letched interpretation to the more obvious and therefore‘the truer ·
one His work is thus perhaps matred by excess oi subtletyand ability,
but subtle and able it is in no ordinary degree.

Orelli's work is distinguished by that thoroughness, sobriety, and
sound sense which make him the prince oi commentatore. His text,
based on a careful silting of the MSS. and adhering wherever it is
possible to the readings ol the Medicean, approximates probably as
closely to the original as, unless some new MS. is discovered, we are
now ever likely to be able to get The notes contain almost all that it
is necessary to know for the elucidationes the text, and are but little
encumbered with superfluous learning. They are what lew notes are—
emineutly readable. The new edition now being brought out under the
joint editorship of Schweizer·Sidler‚ Andresen‚ and Meiser, os which
only the two first books oi the Hritm'es have unfortunately yet appeared,
is being done with conscientiousness and good taste. t

Weoome last to the school edition ol Dr. Karl Heraeus published
at Leipzig in 1864, various later editions oi which have since appeared.
Dr. Heraeus, as is natural in a school edition, occupies himself primarily
with illustrating peculiarities of grammar and construction. His plan
is,as sar as may be, to make Tacitus his own interpreter. His notes
are invaluable as a storehouse oi Tacitean phrases and turns ol ex·
pressiori. But while thus directing his attention in the first instance
to the elucidation ot Tacitus's language, his notes will be found to
contain in addition almost all the extraneous information which is
necessary to the right understanding of the Histon'es, and his interpre-

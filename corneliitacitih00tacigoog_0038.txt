aud early history of the Jewish people will come on for consideration
in the next section

§3 The writers whom we lmow or may suppose that Tacitus
consulted arethe following· —

(a) §iuvius Rufius.. He' ts not indeed directly referred to in the
ffiston'es, but rs twice quoted as an authority in the Annals (xiii ro,
xiv a). Tacitus describes him as‘ ‘vir facundus et pacis artibus, betti
inexpertus’ ’(ἱ.) 8) As he was already a consular at the time of the
assassination of Caius ιιι 41 ab. he was probably an elderly man by
69 an .-perhaps he did not long survive that year; at least we have no
subsequent mention of him, though Teuffel considers rt most probable
that he composed his historical works irr his later years alter he had
retired from politica (5 309, a). The precise limits of his history it is
not easy to determine. Some have thought that it began as early as
the reign of Caius, and that ,he is the authority followed by Josephus
in his description of that prince’s death ; but Tacitus only quotes him
as an authority, in that part of the Annals which has come down tous,
for events in the reign of Nero His Ha‘story certainly included some
account of Verginius, as we gether from the interesting story told in
Plin. Epp ia 19, 5. Pliny there relates that once in his hearing there
took place the following conversation between Cluvius and Verginius
“You know, Verginius,” said Cluvius, “what honesty history demands
1 must, therefore, ask you to pardon me if you read in my history
anything you do not like” To this Verginius replied: “Do you not
know, Cluvius, that I acted as Ι did, in order that you and others might
be free to write about me whatever you pleased?” From Plut. Otho 3,
it further appears that some account of Otho and bis reign must also
have been comprised in Cluvius's worla It is likely that it extended
at least to Vitellius's death. For one remarkable scene shortly before
that event Cluvius must have possessed unusual means of information—
via as to the agreement come to between Vitellius and Flavius Sabinus
for Vitellius’s deposition of the Empire Cluvius Rufus is expressly
mentioned as summoned along with Silius Italicus to be a witness on
the occasion (iii 6 5). Mommsen considers that the common source of
information on which Plutarch, Tacitus, and Suetonius all drew in
their accounts of the reigns of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius was this
ffistosy of Cluvius Rufus.

(b) The older Pliny, C. Plinius Secundus Suetonius (p. 92, ed
Reiffsch) gives the followmg account οΠιίιιι and of his writings

“Plinius Secundus of Novum Comum (in Northem Italy), having taken
an active part in cavalry service (chiefly ιιι Germany), administered
with singular uprightness most distinguished offices during many suc·
cessive years (He was procurator Caesaris under Vespasian of Gallia
Narbonensis and Hispania Tarraconensis.) ln spite of this he gave
himself with such ardour to literary pursuits that scarcely any one
who wasia the enjoyment of perfect leisure wrote more than he did

his path atroublesome rival Certain it is that Otho retained his affec-
tion for the worthless Poppaea even to the end In Lusitania, accord·
ing to all the accounts, he ruled with diligence and uprightness, and
managed to wia the affections of the people whom be govemed3 some-
thing of his fathers spirit would seem here to have descended upon him.
There is little doubt that he returned to Rome in Galba's train in the
hope and with the expectation of being adopted as his. successor, and
that it was the disappointment of seeing Piso preferred before him that
led him immediately to enter on the conspiracy which proved so fatal
to Galba. Yet there can also be but little doubt that Otho had already
perceived the inherent wealrness of Galba's position, and had made
preparation in advance, by ingratiating himself with the soldiery on the
march, and with the praetoriana as soon as he arrived in Rome, for taking
’ advantage of any opportunity which might hereafter arise · The oppor-
tunity came soon enough in the ever-growing discontent of the prae·
torians with Galba, a discontent brought to a head by Galha's refusal
to‘grant them a donative at the time of Piso’s adoption For the
murders of Galba and Piso, it was the soldiers rather than Otho who
were primarily responsible, though he seems to have acquiesced readily
enough in the deeds when done After his accession to the throne
Tacitus speaks as if Otho's character had gone on steadily deteriorating
(“quorum flagitia ac dedecus apertiore in dies fama noscebantur,”
ii 37), and he had given more and more unequivocal signs, as time
went on, of an intention to follow in the footsteps of Nero. Yet there
is little in Otho's own acts, as Tacitus has himself recorded thern, to
narrant such a contention. Otho’s reported joy (b 44) when the news
of Piso's death was brought him may well have beenan invention of
his enemies, and Tacitus gives it only as a report Even if it was not
so, we fear that the code of Roman morality in Otho's time would
not in another have blamed such exultation very severely, and very few
pretenders to a throne have been found to grieve over the removal
of a rival The two next recorded acts of Otho are distinctly in
his favour-his treatment of Marius Celsus and his dealing with the
question of furloughs in the army. Celsus refused to deny his loyalty
to Galba, boasted of it, and represented it to Otho as a claim deserving
recognition. Otho allowed the justice of the claim, admitted Celsus
into the circle of his intimate friends, and chose him one of the leaders
for the war now impending against Vitellius The plan by which he
paid out of his own· purse a fixed yearly compensation to the centurions,
in place of the blackmail which they had previously exacted from the
soldiers as the price of ’ their yearly leave of absence,is allowed by

orto reinhabit Jerusalem, but the temple of Onias, near Heliopolis,
not far from Memphis, the great Jewish sanctuary in Egypt, was shut
up, divested of its votive offerings, and the worship of Jehovah in
it interdicted (M.P.RE ii. 217). Caesarea was converted into a
Roman colony, a new Greek colony was founded at Samaria under
the name of Flavia Neapolis, while security for the future good order
of the land was taken by the establishment on the desolate site of
Jerusalem of a camp for a legion and its contingent of auxiliaries, to
which was given the name of Aelia ⁸Capitolina.

Egypt occupied at this time a place unique and singular in the
Roman world It was regarded as the most important of all the
provinces under imperial administration Tm importance attached to
it is seen in the fact that the emperor kept the administration of it
permanently in his own hands, forbidding senators even to enter it
without express permission, while he ruled it through a Roman knight
whom he appointed directly himself. Further proof of its unique
position may be gathered from this, that when Vespasium had resolved
on attempting to seiae the throne, he chose the occupation of Egypt as
his own share in the enterprise, leaving to subordinates even the
invasion of Italy itself What gave to Egypt this unique importance
was partly its own almost unassailable position, partly the share
contributed by it to the corn-supply of Rome, one third of the whole
quantity required being derived from it, partly the very considerable
contribution it made to the imperial exchequer, ·

Besides appqinting its knightly prefect the emperor filled up directly
himself several other of the more important posts in the administration. ’
Tht country outside the towns was divided into thirty-six districts or
nomes (vopei), usually named after some god whose temple was the
centre of the district These land-districts were quite destitute of

autonomy3 administration, taxation, justice, were all placed in the hands ’

of imperial officials Nor was the case much otherwise with the cities;
they too had no common council elected by themselves, no elective
magistrates3 they were ruled by officers appointed by the emperor.
There was in consequence of this arrangement no common diet for
Egypt, composed of representatives from the various districts and
states, such as was to be found in many provinces of the Empire The
emperor himself ruled throughout the land, by means of the representa-
tives whom he had himself appointed The revenues throughout the
province went direct into the imperial exchequer, and reached a very
large amount-twenty million bushels of wheat (derived, however, in
part fronf the extensive imperial domnia-lands) besides a considerable,
‘though unascertainable, sum of money.

The Helleues under the rule of the Ptolemies had been placed in

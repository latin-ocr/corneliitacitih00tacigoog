, deprived the nobles of the influen'ce to which they considered they were

entitled, while his failure to consult them even in the choice of his
successor, however much they might approve the justice arrd the motives
of bis choiee, was gall and wormwood to them. They wished at least
to have the semblance of power even if they had lost its substance

And so when Galba fell he fell with scarcely a friend to defend
him or even to mourn him. He whom, before he had been emperor,
all would have pronounced fit for the post had, when the opportunity
came to him, been tried and found wanting. No doubt it was his
very virtues which had in part helped to rain him-his stemness, his
old-fashioned views of discipline, his¹ carefulness, his integrity. But
virtues alone, or at any rate virtues of the lrind which Galba possessed,
do not frt a man for high place, there needs besides ,a certain width of
mind, a certain largeness of view, a certain genial sympathy, a power of
rising to the opportunities which high estate fumishes3 in all these
qualities Galba, in common with most of his order at Rome, was
singularly deficient, aad because he was deficient in them his career

Tacitus's account of Otho has been attached from two sides On
the one hand, it has been contended that in the sketch of the closing
scene of his life Tacitus has been too favourable to him, and has in·
vested it with a halo of glory to which it is not really entitled, since
Otho had, after the defeat at Bedriacum, practically to take the choice
between putting an end to his own life or being captured by the enemy,

senatorial point of view and following in the main authorities who
wrote from a senatorial standpoint, has done something less than justice
to Otho himself, over-rating his crimes and errors and under-stating or
slurring over the difficulties which in consequence of the treachery and
ill-will of the senatorial leaders surrounded his whole career. Α 1 shall
indicate certain reasons which incline me to adopt this latter view.

Marcus Salvius Otho was in almost every respecta complete contrast
to his predecessor Galba Unlilre Galba he belonged not to any one
of the great Roman houses, but to the provincial nobility of Etruria
His mother was spmng from no very distinguished stock, being the
daughter of a Roman knight. His grandfather was a favourite with
Livia Augusta, and rose into note in that way. His father, a brave
and capable officer, served faithfully first Tiberius and then Claudius,
the latter of whom was so pleased with his conduct that he honoured
him with the compliment that the utmost he could wish was that his
children might not be unworthy of him The young Otho himself was
unfortunately brought up not in the camp but in the court ; he was
in quite early youth a favourite of Nero, and was believed to bave
shared in the worst excesses of that emperor. It is certain that it
was at his house that Nero met Poppaea Sabina, who had deserted

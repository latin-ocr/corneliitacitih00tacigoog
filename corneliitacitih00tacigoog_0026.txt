ιι ’ INTRODUCTION 'l

intended to bridge over the gap which separated the year 69 an. from
that earlier epoch when “the successes and reverses ol the Roman
people were recounted by brilliant authors,'' and from those days oi
Augustus, “lor telling the story ol which there was no lack of elever
menTthigpbaiabce ol the Agricola did not very long precede that
oi the Historias. Tm iirst was probably published about 98 nu,
early in Trajan's reign, the latter perhaps two or three years later. It
is obvious lrom Agricolae 3, that when he published the Agricola,
Tacitus was already at work on the Historias. Yet the smaller work
was not designed directly to supplement, or even to pave the way, lor
the larger; its publication was dictated bya genuine desire on Tacitus’s
part to preserve and to do honour to the memory ol a good and
distinguished man, with whom, as his son-inlgw, he was himself
intimately connected. The study, however, of Agricola’s lise and
character gave him the opportunity of treating in a somewhat different
manner, and from a different point ol view, a portion oi the period he
was alterwards to traverse in his larger work, and oi drawing out some
what more explicitly some of the lessons he thought were to be derived
lrom the study ol the times The temper of the work is not, as wc
should expect, seriously different {rom that which breathes through the
lasona. ⁴· In both ol them we¹ lind combined the same detraction oi
the existing state oi things with the same hopelessness ol ellecting any
remedy ol the evils from which the'state and the age suffered' In
both works alilre the epoch is regarded as one in which Rome “can
neither endure the evils under which she labours nor the remedies
which would be ellectual to cure them.” In both the presence oi lights
among the shadows is recognised; only in both the lights are so treated
aa to make the shadows look darker and more black. In both works,
again, we meet with the same spirit oi depressing latalism-a beliel,
that while the gods· are not wholly indifferent to the affairs ol men,
they interiere only to punish, never to help. ln one point the Agricola
supplements in an important way the gap which has been leli vacant ,
by the lost books ol the Historias. lt has let us into the secret ol
the horror with which the closing years oi Domitian’sx reign filled the
whole soul ol Tacitus (Ag. 45, 46), a' horror which, we cannot doubt,
has coloured our anthor's representation of the whole imperial period.
The dark colours in which he has painted in the Annols the later years
of Tiberius’s rule owe at least some oi their gloom to the sense that
Tiberius's evil acts were an anticipationos, perhaps a preparation lor,
the miseries aud the degradation which Tacitus had himself experienced

at the hands ol Domitiam while his judgment on some ol the events
· ol 69 an. is overshadowed by the sense that they were the introduc·
tion to that series oi events ol which the tyranny oi Domitian was the κ
culminating point and climax. Il here and there a more kindly and
sympathetic spirit breaks out in the Agricola than is to be met with in

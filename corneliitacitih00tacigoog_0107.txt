88 THE HISTORIES OF TA'CITUS sacr.

peculias in the situation and gave it for a time its supreme danger was
that the legions themselves in some cases turned against Rome and
preferred to fraternise with the enemy rather than retain the empire
for a ruler whom they feared and disliked, since be owed his throne to
the prowess of forces which they justly regarded as their rivals. The
personal wrongs inflicted on Civilis by the death of his brother and
his own imprisonment were but the spark which set lire to the inflam-
mable material everywhere just then to be met with.

The Batavian country which formed the focus of the revolt was the
long island which lies between the two southemmost mouths of the
Rhine. The inhabitants of this island, though they counted in Roman·
times as Gauls, had come originally from Germany. Tacitus (Germ 29)
believed them to have been a branch of the Chatti They pald no
taxes nor tribute to Rome, but provided instead an unusual number
of first-rate troops Besides serving in the emperor’s bodyguard they
fumished no fewer than 9000 infantry and 1000 horse The greater
part of the infantry force—8000 out of the total 9000—was attached
shortly before this time to the 14th legion serving then in Britain.
It was mainly by their bravery and that of the legion to which they
were attached that Suetonius Paulinus had won the decislve victory
over the forces of Boadicea which had saved the Roman dominion in
Britain (Introd. iv. ἓ 5). The fame they had acquired by their signal
services in this action made them one of the most distinguished corps
in the Roman army. Nero towards the end of his reign had sum-
moned them, together with the legion to which they were attached, to
Rome with a view of their taking part in the expedition against the
Parthians which he was then, meditating. As they were advancing
through Gaul they were met by the news of the revolt of Vindex and
of Verginius's subsequent victory. On receipt of this news the legion
and their auxiliary force parted company. The legion marched on
into Italy, perhaps with the intention of helping Nero; subsequently
they were despatched by Galba, who mistrusted them, into Dalmatia.
The auxiliaries remained behind among the Lingones in Gaul, and it
was theinmnwillingness at this time to follow the legion which led, at

' least in their own estimation, to Nero's downfall It is to the suspicions
of treachery which this refusal engendered, and the resentment which
it excited in the minda of the legionary troops, that the death of
Claudius Paulus and the imprisonment of Civilis himself are to be
attributed When Galba succeeded to the throne Civilis was released
and returned to the troops whom he had previously commanded3 but
he was shortly afterwards again cast by the legionaries into chains, and
only escaped punishment by the clemency or sluggishness of Vitellius
(H. i. 59 ; iv. r 3). After this, considering himself no longer safe in
the neighbourhood of the Roman legions'he retired from the force
he had led with so much distinction, and sought for a time arefuge

proclaimed emperor the main body of Batavians J'oined the forces of
Valens (i. 64), though a smaller band of them seem also to have
attached themselves to Caecina The jealousy with which they were
still regarded hythe legionaries at the very outset of the war all but
occasioned a fresh disturbance. We next hear of the Batavian cohorte
shortly before the battle of Bedriacum (H. it η). Valens had
proposed to despatch some of thern to the defence of Gallia Narbon-
ensis, at that time threatened by the Othonian fleet This was objected
to by the Batavians themselves, and also by the legionary troops, who
considered that they would be in this way deprived of their most
·trustworthy supports. Matters went to such lengths that Valens himself ι
suffered personal violence in the excitement occasioned by his pmposal,
and was at length compelled to seek for safety in ssight and conceal·
ment When it was known that the project had been abandoned
prassions gradually cooled down, and the Batavians suffered themselves
to be led along with the other troops to effecta junction with Caecina,
who was at that time being hard pressed by the forces under the
command of Celsus and Paulinus. In the battle of Bedriacum itself,
which followed shortly after .this„the Batavians found themselves
arrayed on the opposite side to their ancient comrades of the rath
legion, some of whom were actually present in the battle while others
were hastening up to Otho’s assistance. And it was nemean part
which they played in the actual frght3 it was their sudden arrival on
the scene which detennined the issue of the conflict3 for alter routing
a band of gladiatore who had been brought across the Po by the
Othonian leaders, they were able to talre the enemy in the flanlr at the
moment when they were already beginning to hesitate, and thus
couverted a doubtful victory into a crushiug defeat (ii. 43). After
the victory Vitellius, anxious to get rid of thern as an unstable and
dangerous power, despatched them along with their whilom comrades
of the r4th legion baclr into Britain (ii. 66). Such ill-assorted com·
panions did not, however, remain long at peace At Turin the two
quarrelled and fought, nor were they separated till the Batavians had
suffered heavy loss, and the arrival of some praetorian cohors on the
scene had given to the legionaries an overwhelming superiority. The
auxiliariae hereupon refused to accompany the legion any farther on
its return rnareh into Britain, and breaking away from it turned aside
along the Rhine, intending apparently to regain their own country.
This was the position of affairs when in the early autumn of 69 ab.
Vespasian's forces under Antonius and Varus began their march into
Italy. Aa they advanced on Rome the leaders sent letters to the
Batavians inviting thern to make common c'ause with thern, and to
effect adiversion in their favour by taking up arms against the scanty
remnants of Vitellius's army,.lelt behind in Germany for the delence of
the frontier. And indeed these forces might almost seem to invite

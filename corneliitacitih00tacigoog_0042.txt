l‘tolemy Philadelphus Our author may have supplemented Manetho's
narrative from Justin and Diodorus The account ol the Mosaic
legislation represents in part the current reports circulated among the
Romans to the discredit of the Jews, in part it ‘corresponds to observ-
aucea actually enjoined in the law. The view taken ol Jewish worship
represents that which was current in Rome when Tacitus wrote. On
the whole the unlavourable impression which Tacitus has formed ol
the people, their religion, their customs, accords with the bitter feeling
which their long-continued resistance and lierce fanaticism had aroused
in their Roman antagonists, and the prevailing dislile which their ever·
increasing pride and isolation had bred in the ancient world Judaism
'had grown harder and more exclusive as the days os the tall of Jerusalem
drew near, and when their religious centre was overthrown the people
were still regarded with suspicion and dislilre.

Iooking then to the general character ol the materials which
Tacitus used in the composition oi the Hr‘storr'es, it is observable that
lor every event and scene he describes he had first-hand authorities;
that his own recollections must have covered a good deal of what he
had to tell; that when these failed it was easy for him to consult in
most cases those who were present and had taken a part in the doings
with respect to which he wished for informati0n3 that when he has to
rely on the accounts of previous writers, these writers were themselves
generally men oi affairs competent to givea trustworthy narrative ot' the
events they describe The materiali being thus abundant and thus
excellent on which he could draw, the iailure, it lailure existed, must
be traeed to defects inherent in Tacitus himself, tolwant ol diligence
or want oi impartiality. That he was wanting in diligence lew have
asserted or can believe; his work shows throughout unmistakable signs
oia caresul and trustworthy investigator. With respect to the details oi
military campaigns we could indeed sometimes wish lor more fulness
and precision-though even here, we think, he is more to be relied on
than some modern critics will allow; but this inexactness in describing
military operations was a delect which he ahares with almost all other
writers ol Roman history‚a defect due probably to that rhetorical
training which almost all Roman historians received That Tacitus
wished and tried to be impartial he most solemnly assures us; that he
was so we cannot entirely admit A partisan ol the Senate and oi the
senatorial point ol view he probably does somewhat more than justice ’
to Galba, less than justice to Otho and even to Vitellius. His
detestation ol Domitian and oi his tyranny has also led him to deplet
in unduly uniavourable colours the whole history of the rise ol the
flavian House Yet we cannot say that, in the Historiis at any rate,
he has greatly mlsjudged His judgments are, if anything, somewhat
hard and stem; yet the times of which he wrote were certainly such as
to call lor and to justily such judgments.

Hierapolis. These all dated from a time later than Alexander's con-
quests, being founded for the most part hy Alexander’s successors, who
inherited from him the policy of graecising the interior by means of
these new Greek urban communities. Comparatively few cities owed
their foundation to the Romans, as the work had already been done
before they appeared on the scene Pergamus and Ephesus shared
between them the honour of being the capital of the province, the one
being so dejure, the other de facto. Smyrna came very little behind
them in importante, wealth, and population. To several other cities
the title of metropolis was granted The rivalry between the different
states was very keen, leading sometimes even to civil worse but it had
at least this advantagenthat it fomented local patriotism and led various
individuals to endow their native states with many munificent gista
Comparatively few of these towns were free citiee, not nearly as many
as in Greece proper, hut they were all allowed considerable liberty in the
organisation of their municipal institutions and in the choice of their
city authorities Under this order of things agriculture, trade, and
commerce flourished; the roads were well kept up, and the resources
which Asia contributed to the state treasury were among the most con·
siderable that it received. Literary activity too prevailed in the different
towns, though nothing of first-rate quality was produced. On the other
hand Asia contributed very little to the army3 its population was not
warlike, and from a military point of view, except for its wealth, it did
not rank high. It was ruled bya senatorial governor who ordinarily
resided at Ephesus, but like other senatorial govemors he had no
troops athis command, and could therefore take no active part in the
civil wars which raged around him.

Asia, like most of the other provinces, had a diet partly political‚
partly religious in character 3 as political it brought the grievances of
the province under the attention of the authorities, as religious it pro
vided for and centred in the worship of the emperor. The chief priest
of the emperor's temple was not only the most eminent dignitary of the
province, but throughout its bounds the year was designated after him.
With the temple were associated festal games, held each year also in
honour of the emperor. The president of these games, yearly elected,
was called Asiarch, and the office was highly priaed. In time the
towns of the province were no longer content with a single temple of
the emperor among them, but sought each of them to erect one for
itself. The possession of a temple conferred distinction on the town
which had it Round these extra tempies extra games and festivals
grew up 3 but in the case of these extra temples the same individual
seems to have combined the offices of chief priest and president of
the games ·To these chief priests fell the duty of seeing that no vor-
ships in‘compatible with that of the emperor were tolerated within the
district over which they presided, hence they took the lead in virtue of
their office in the persecution of the Christians ; on the other hand,

part oi Cilicia was at this time included in Pamphylia, while its eastern
and more fruitiul portion was annexed to Syria

Resides the provinces ol Asia Minor there were interposed between
them and the Parthian empire certain more or less dependent king-
doms. This was in accordance with the general policy of· Rome,
which always sought to interpose between herself >and any formidable
neighbour a buffer in the shape oi a semidependent state. The first
os these was Armenia Armenia at this time was govemed by Tiridates.
Tiridates was the nominee os the Parthian king Vologaesus, but accord-
ing to an agreement concluded by the Roman general Corbulo in
·66 an. he had received his crown from Nero’s hands. Praetically,
however, Armenia counted as part oi the Parthian, not the Roman
dominions, and as such took no part in the vars oi the period.

Sophene being the south-western district ol Armenia, lying along
the upper Euphrates, formed at this time part of the¹ dominions oi
King Sohaemus He threw in his lot with Vespasian as soon as he had
been proclaimed 'emperor by the legions os Syria (ii 81), and is
mentioned also (v. 1) as iumishing troops lor the Judaic war.

Thirdly‚ there was the kingdom oi Commagene lying still farther
south It was a strip oi land bounded on the west by Mount
Amanus, north by the Taurus range, east by the Euphrates, south
by the provinces of Syria and Cilicia Its iring, Antiochus, the last
survivor oi the Seleucida, and the richest, according to Tacitus, of the
subject kings, brought like Sohaemus early help to Vespasian, and
was in this way instrumental in securing for him the throne (ii. 81).

character os their population, were the two outlying provinces ol Cyprus
and os Crete and Cyrene. They were both senatorial provinces3 both had
a population mainly Greek, but with a certain admixture oi barbarians3
both had a large Jewish settlement established in their midst. Neither
counted ior much in the Civil War. Cypms was visited by Titus,
attracted thither hythe same of the shrine oi the Paphian Venus, on his
return voyage from Europe to the East The people ol Cyrene are
merely mentioned as bringing to justice their proconsul, Antonius
Flamma, in the early days ol Vespasian's reign (iv. 45) The islandus
Crete, which formed a single province along with Cyrene, was even less
important at this tirne than the former district Mentioned incidentally
once or twice in the Annals, it is passed otrer altogether in the Histon‘es,
except that Tacitus alludes to it (v. a) as the supposed birthplace os the

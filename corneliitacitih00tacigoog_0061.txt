42 THE HISTORIES OF TACITUS sacr.

Sicily was the oldest oi the transmarine possessions oi Rome, the
first oi her provinces It came into her possession as the result ol the
first Punic var. In old days Rome had derived much ol her corn
supply from this lertile island, but aiter the acquisition ol Africa and
Egypt the corn, which used to be obtained from Sicily, was obtained
more cheaply from them, and the island lost much ol the importance
it had previously had Though it still continued to be ruled hya
senatorial governor it beoame to all intents and purposes a part of
Italy, and apparently not one oi the more important or thriving parts.
It is scarcely mentioned by Tacitus in the Annals, and not once in the
Irh'ston‘es.

These two islands were next to Sicily the earliest acquired foreign
possessione ol Rome. She toolr them from Carthage in the Interval
between the first and the second Punic wars at a time when Carthage
was occupied by a revolt oi her subjects in Africa. The unjust seizure
ol the islands was one ol the causes which helped most directly to bring
about the second Punic var. The islanda thus unjustly acquired did
not prove much ot a blessing to Rome The low-lying coast lands
were unhealthy; the mountains teemed with brIganda whom it was
difficult to reduce to and keep in order. At the partition oi the pro
vinces Augustus had originally assigned the two islands to the Senate,
but in consequence oi the prevalence ol brigandageTIberius bad himseli
sInce 'taken them over, and they were govemed till the time oi Nero
by the emperor. Nero had given them baclr to tbe Senate, but the
officer in charge was still styled procurator. At the commencement
ot the war between Otho and Vitellius the presence oi Otho’s fleet in
their neighbourhood had at first secured the islanda ior the Othoniana
(ii. 16). But Pacarius, the procurator, out oi hostility to Otho deter-
miued that Corsica at any rate should throw in its lot with the cause
oi Vitellius He had murdered those who had the good sense to
oppose his desIgns, and iorced the islanders to swear allegiance to the
chief oi his choice. But when he proceeded further to drill them and
to attempt to make them submit to military discipline the unruly
natives repented oi their weakness ln giving way to him 3 they bided
their time, caught him unprotected and off his guard, murdered him,
and carried oli his head as a trophy to Otho. Yet the acquisition or
loss ol the islanda did not, as Tacitus says, affect very much the main
issue of the war; and as Vitellius and Vespasian successively conquered
on the plains oi Italy, the islands ol the neighbouring sea passed along

with Italy itseli into the hands oi the conquerors (ii 16).

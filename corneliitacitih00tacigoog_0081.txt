62 THE HISTORIES OF TACITUS sacr.

an exceptionally favoured position as compared with the native Egyp
tians, They had been less heavily taxed, less subject to personal mal-
treatment and indignity; they alone might serve in the higherhranches
of the army3 they alone were eligible for municipal office. Under
Roman rule they retained most of their privileges. A native Egyptian
could not attain to Roman citizenship, a Greek by entering 'the army
could, while the highest offices were restricted to Roman knights; a
Greek after he had obtained the citicenship was sometimes appointed to
the higher posta, and the lower offices were almost entirely filled by them,
principally by Greeks from Alexandria, to the complete exclusion of
the native Egyptians. Even from the auxiliary foroes the native Egyp
tians were as a mle excluded, and those were recruited consequently
almost solely from the Greeks The only service on which native
Egyptians were employed vas the manning of the lieet, a purpose for
which slaves were still largely used in the time of Augustus The chief,
if not the sole, occupation of the natives was the cultivation of the soil.
This at the time we are considering was carried to a high state of
perfectiora The fertility of the soil in Egypt mainly depends on the
yearly overllow of the Nile. In Roman times the inundation was
artificially extended by means of waterworks, canals, ditches, and
reservoirs, so that while before the Roman occupation a rise of only
eight cubita produced a failure in the harvest, anda full harvest
required a rise of fourteen cubits, in Roman times eight cubits sufficed
to secure a sufficient, twelve a bountiful, crop. The crops raised were
chiefly wheat, vegetables, vines, and the date-palm. The wheat harvest
principally went to Rome and formed, as we have already said, almost
the most important item in its comsupply,'the yield from Africa alone
being equal or superior. The taxes on the population who farmed the
land were, aa they are alasl still, exceedingly heavy, and left, aller they
were paid, a very narrow margin for the people’s support. While agri-
culture formed the staple industry of the country districts and of the
native population, trade and manufactures were carried on in the towns
particularly hythe Greek inhabitants of Alexandria The chief articles
of manufacture were linen (Egyptian linen had long been famous
throughout the world), glass, paper, and other products of the papyrus
plant. Besides its native industries Egypt was the great emporium for
=all the products of the East, and the passage of such goods through
the countryjlbrought wealth also to its inhabitants. The granite and
porphyry so largely used in the later buildings of imperial Rome came
mainly from the quatries of Egypt, but the full development of this
trade belongs to a later date. The foreign trade of Egypt extended
to the east not only all along the Red Sea, as far south as Zanzibar on
the African coast, but even to the ports of India The chief Egyptian
ports on the Red Sea were Berenice and Myos Hormos in the central
district, and farther north Arsinoe or Cleopatris, and Clysma. From
Myos Hormos goods were often taken overland to Coptos ou the

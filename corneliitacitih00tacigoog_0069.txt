50 THE HISTORIES OF TA CITUS secr.

the mainland there were created into free cities, besides Athens,
Tanagra, Thespiae, Plataea, Delphi, Abae, Elataea, and Amphissa 3 all
these had within certain limits the right of sels-govemment, of managing
their own affairs, imposing their own fiscal burdens and electing their
own magistrates. The non-free towns were allowed to meet in common
diet at Argos, to elect a Helladarch, and to provide for the 'religious
concems of the union; only their resolutions had to be approved by
the Roman proconsul But in spite of lenient treatment hythe
emperor and the privileges thus conferred upon it the province did not
thrive It had suffered grievously in the timesof the civil wars, the
three decisive battles having then been fought within its borders.
Its population faded away, industry declined, its cities decayed, and
the free cities were often unable to maintain even decent order or
to keep themselves free from debt The land retained indeed, in
virtue of its past glories, a certain intellectual pre-eminenoe, and

, cultivated Romans continued to visit it 'for the memories which were
associated with it, but it had ceased to be the mother of statesmen
or of soldiers; it contributed practically nothing to the Roman levy,
and was no longer of any account from a military or a political point
of view. It is not surprising, then, that it took no part in the events
of 69 au. For a moment indeed it was alarmed by the appearance
on its coasts ofa pretended Nero (ii. 8); but the impostor was quickly
killed, the panic passed away, and the land settled down again into
a condition of expectancy, waiting to see to which of the combatants it
would pass as a prey.

Asia Minor was divided at this time into the following provinces-
Asia, Bithynia and Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Pamphylia, and Lycia.

(r) Of these Asia was at once the most ancient and the most im·
portant It passed to the Romans by hequest from Attalus, king of
Pergamus. It was the richest district of Asia Minor, including almost
all the fruitful valleys which open on to the Aegean Sea3 it was bounded
by Bithynia on the north, by Lycia on the south, the Rhyndacus which
runs into the Propontis, and Mount Olympus forming the boundary in
the one case, and a small stream called the Calbis in the other. Galatia
was its neighbour to the east, the boundary between the two being so
drawn as to give to Asia the whole of the river valleys which run west·
ward and a' considerable part os the Phrygian highlanda It thus
comprised nearly all Phrygia, Mysia, Lydia, Caria, the Aeolian, Ionian
and Dorian Greek cities, as well as most of the adjacent islanda and
the Cyclades. The most flourishing Greek cities in these times were
Ephesus, the capital of the district, Tralles, Smyrna, Pergamus, the two
Magnesias, Alexandria Troas, and Rhodes. Resides the towns os the
sea-coast there existed a number of thriving inlund towns founded
also on the Greek model, such as Synnada, Apamea, Laodicea, and

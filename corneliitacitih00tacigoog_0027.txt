8 THE HISTORIES OF TA CITUS stret.

the Historias and the Annalr, this is rather to be ascribed to the genuine
enthusiasm felt by the writer for the subject os his memoir than to his
taking at this earlier date any happier or more hopelul view of lise and
society as a whole His very love for his 'hero seems to have been in
part dictated by the contrast he presents to the prevailing sordidness, .
meanness, and incapacity ol the times in which he lived.

The composition oi the Gennanria seems to have belonged to
almost the same time as that of the Agricola. The mention of Trajan’s
second consulship in c 37 appears to place its publication in 98 ab,
the date ol that second consulship. Like the Agn'cola, it was, therc-
fore, written when the composition oi the Hr'ston'es was not only
contemplated but was also apparently well advanced It is probable
enough, as haslbeen often contended, that one obiect which Tacitus
had in the preparation of the treatise was by means oi it to satirise
manners, characters, customs, and institutions which lay nearer home;
and he certainly omits no opportunity ln' the course of the work
ol pointing the contrast between the moral and manful independenoe
of these children of nature, and the cormpt manners and degraded
servitude ol his own more civilised countrymen3 but it seems simplet
and more natural to ascribe the origin ol the work to the historian's
anxiety to impart by anticipation to the readers of bis Histon'cs a more
exact knowledge ol the localities occupied by the German people‚
their customs, religion, and tribal differences, than he could well find
space for in the main current of his narrative. Germany is selected as
the subject ol a separate treatise, partly on account of the important
part which the German armies and the free peoples of Germany play
during the years which are covered by the Historias, partly, perhaps,
though this is matter of conjecture, because Tacitus’s own official duties
had given him exceptional opportunities lor obtaining information about
the country. Anyway the work lumishcs a most useful introduction to
large portions ol the latoria. Many ol the details in this latter
work, particularly in the account of the outbrealt ol Civilis, would be
unintelligible to those who had not prepared themselves to understand
them by the study of the Germany or some similar book, while the
perusal ol it could scarcely fail to invest the whole ol this part of the
fflstories with additional interest No doubt on many points we should
like fuller and more definite information than the Germany fumishea
The limits ol the different tribes, the exact position occupied by thern,
their migrations in earlier or in later times, have been leit by Tacitus
provokingly vague and indefinite; but we must remember that he was
writing without definite maps for readers who had no chance of con·
sulting them; and the country moreover was one which was toa great
extent closed to Romans, and which was visited by them, it visited at
all, not lor purposcs of scientific research, but lor trade Under these
circumstances the matter lor surprise is not that Tacitus should have
done so little but that he should have done so much, and that he

legate of the 15th legion and commander of the forces in Vetera, to
take the field against the enemy. Lupercus obeys, but his troops were
half-hearted, while the desertion in the battle of a Batavian cohort
which accompanied them, and of the majority of their Gallie auxiliaries,
left them with little spirit for fight, and they again sought shelter
almost at once within the fortifications of Vetera Tidings meanwhile
of their countrymen'a successes had reached the Batavian cohorte
stationed at Maina They were already under orders to y'oin Vitellius
in ltaly, but now they demanded as a price of compliance terms which
no commander could grant, and when Flaccus at last refused to accede
to them, using his refusal as a justification of their rebellion they marched
oli in the direction of their own homes. Even then Hordeonius still
hesitated3 at one moment he sent orders to Herennius Gallus, legate
of the ast legion and commander at Bono, to bar their passage,
promising himself to hang on their rear and hamper their advance3 at
the next he sent counter orders to leave thern alone, and himself
remained inactive in his own headquarters. Gallus on receipt of the
first orders came out at the head of two thousand legionaries, a great
host of nondescripts and camp followers, some countrymen, and some ’
Gallie auxiliaries, prepared to offer battle to the insurgent troops3 but
the Batavians forming themselves into close columns had no difficulty
in brushing aside the feeble resistance thus offered them, and speedily
compelled Gallus and his undisciplined levy to seelr a hasty shelter
within their fortifications‚ leaving not a few of their comrades dead on
the field of battle. Bonn passed, the insurgents making a detour to
avoid Cologne, proceeded unmolested for the reat of their journey to
join their victorious countrymen in the neighbourhood of Vetera.
Arrived amonglt them they formed such a considerable addition
to the forces under command of Civilis that he now ventured on a
more pronounced step'than any he had yet talen. Having made his
own soldiers taire an oath of allegiance to Vespasian, he called on the
troops stationed: in Vetera to do the same. Met by their indignant
refusal and profession of undying loyalty to Vitellius, he summoned the
Germans east of the Rhine to his aid, and advanced with his troops
deployed along either bank of the river to the siege of Vetera The
two legates of the legions in command, Numisius Rufus and Munius
Lupercus, did their best in the short time* allowed them to put the
camp in a position to stand asiege. They strengthened the fortifica·
tions, pulled down the private houses and other outlying buildings,
which growing up in the period of peace might now afiord shelter to the
enemy, and attempted as far as they could to collect provisions for
a siege Unfortunately this attempt was in a great measure frustrated
by the greediness and rapacity of the soldiers themselves Vetera was
regarded as the key of Lower Germany, commanding on the one side
the flat country which lay to the north of it, and on the other the
valley of the Lippe, up which access could be gained to the tableland

The‘warnings the examples of history, then, in Tacitus’s eyes, give
it its value. It is because it sumishes such warnings and examples
that he cared to write it The point oi view has, as we have said
above, now changed3 yet we are inclined to think that it is one, and not
the least, oi the advantages oi the perusal of history in ancient authors
that they have preserved lor us a point oi view in the study oi it, which
our own age is somewhat rashly and prematurely only too ready to set
aside and undertate No doubt the ideal history would be a synthesis
oi the two points oi view, the moral and the scientific Scientific history
(if the term is not a misnomer) need not leave out the moral lessons
which history teaches, and history which points a moral need not be
deficient in scientific exactness and detail. But the ideal history has
still to be written3 and meanwhile we shall do well to remind ourselves
that there is another side to the teaching oi history than that which is
now most dwelt upon ; and there are lew authors in whom that other
side is set forth with more force and perspicuity than it is in Tacitus,
few, that is, who lay before us more tellingly and unilinchingly the great
moral truths which history inculcatas. 1t is because this is so that
his writings have up to today lost nothing of their value, and can be
read by the moralist with as much advantage as they can be by the
historiari, or the lover oi literature.

There are three 'distinct sources of information on which Tacitus
must have drawn in the composition of his Historias :- .

1. Personal observation and recollections.

2. The accounts oi those who were eye-witnesses otiand took a part
in, the events he describes. ’

. 3. The narratives of previous writers who had treated ol the ’

nme period .

Between the first and the second ol these sources of'iniormation it
is oiten hard to discriminate There are scarcely any ol the events
which took place in Rome at which Tacitus might not have been
present ; there are still lewer events, whether in Rome or elsewhere,
accounts oi which he may not have received lrorn those who were
present at, or took a part in, them. All we can do is to indicate
those portions oi the narrative which seem to bear the stamp ol
personal recollections, and those which were derived probably stom
the narratives of others. With respect to events which took place at
a distanoe from Rome, Tacitus would seem to have drawn his informa-
tion mainly from the accounts ol previous writers—a comparison ol his
accounts with those oi Plutarch, where they cover the same ground, ·
makes the fact that both authors drew lrom a common source almost
certain5 but there are also lew ol these events, extra details with

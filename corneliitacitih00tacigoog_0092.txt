the help of supreme power to shake himself free of the evil influences
of the past, aud voluntarily quitting life when he found the force of
circumstances too strong for him. Vitellius’s case is that of a man
who, raised almost against his will, certainly without any active efforts
’ on his own part, to supreme power, made use of it merely to indulge
to the full his sordid vices of sottishness and gluttony. He came, it
must be confessed, of a bad stocla The court antiquarians. seem to
have tried to invent a pedigree for him when he was emperor, hut the
first Vitellius of whom history has anything to record was his grand·
father Publius Vitellius of Nuceria, who rose to be a Roman knight
anda procurator under Augustus This man had four distinguished
sons-Aulus, Quintus, Publius, Lucius Aulus died in his consulship ;
Quintus became a senator but was removed from that body by Tiberius;
Publius, the friend aud companion of Gennanicus, prosecuted after his
death his supposed murderer, Cu. Piso-afterwards, having been
believed to be mixed up in the conspiracy of Sejanus, and placed in
safe keeping by Tiberius with his brother, he died while in confine· ,
ment Lucius, the youngest, the father of the future emperor, rose to
be consul and distinguished himself in Syria, where he succeeded
in winning over Artabanus, the Parthian king, to do homage for
his throne to the emperor Tiberius; but after his return to Rome '
his character changed for the worse, and he did not shrink from
ingratiating himself with successive emperors-Caius, Claudius, and
Nero-by the basest and lowest arts of villany and flattery. He was
thrice consul and Claudius's colleague in the censorship. ¹Vitellius
himself, this man’s son, was brought up amid the luxury and the tainted
atmosphere of the court His boyhood he spent with Tiberius at
Capreae; with Claudius he became a favourite by playing with him at
dice3 Nero he flattered for bis singing and won his beart in that way.
By such arts he rose to the consulship. The one honourable episode
in his career was his administration of the province of Africa, where he
gained the love of the peopie by uprightness and affability. He is
reported to have owed his command in Lower Germany to Galba's con·
temptuously selecting him for it as one from whom he would have little ,
to fear. When he accepted it, his fortunas are said to have reached
so low an ebb that he had to leave his wife and children in a hired
lodging in Rome, having let his own house, and to pawn his 'mother's
earrings to meet the expenses of the journey. Arrived in Germany it
seems to have been far enough from his own thoughts to enter on any
conspiracy, he was goaded into it by the urgency of others, by the
exhortations of Valens and Caecina, and by the impetuosity of the
soldiers themselves. With the soldiers he was, in spite of his defects,
undoubtedly a favourite. A certain jovial good-nature, which often
accompainies an easy sslf-indulgent nature like his, made him generally
popular, nor was he above descending to lower arts to conciliate good-

90 THE HISTORIES OF ΤΑ CITUS sacr.

Valens and Caecina into Italy. The great majority of those who
remained had followed Vitellius when ‘he advanced southward. Their
places had been filled by recruits hastily raised among the tribes oi
Gaul, who had had no experience in war and had acquired no loyalty
towards their officere The auxiliary forces who supported the. legions
had been entirely raised from the tribes in the immediate neighbour-
hood, and shared all the interests and passions of their fellowcountry-
men. The officers were regarded by the whole army with dislilre and
suspicion, since the soldiers believed them secretly to favour the cause
of Vespasian, while they were themselves devoted adherents of Vitellius,
, whom their swords arrd those of their comrades had been mainly
instrumental in placing on the throne. Hordeonius Flaccus, whom
Vitellius had left in command of the whole district, was a wealr
old man crippled with gout, without initiativedecision, or authority.

The outbreak originated in the island itself. Here Vitellius had
ordered a fresh levy to be raised to fill up some of the gaps caused by
the departure of troops for Italy. The levy was conducted harshly
and cruelly, and discontent and exasperation were the natural con·
sequences Civilis, who had already received the Flavianist despatches,
avails himself of the state of feeling to stir up insurrection among his
fellow·countrymen‚ calling at the same time upon the Canninefates
who occupied the northern part of the Batavian island, the Frisii who
dwelt on the seacoast just north of the Rhine, and the cohorts who
had quitted the 14th legion and were now stationed at Mainz, to join
the movement The first blow was struck by the Canninefates and
Frisii Setting suddenly upon the scattered garrisons who held the
island for the Romans, they put the maiority of them to the sword.
The survivors gathered at the eastern end of the island under a
centurion named Aquilius, resolved to make what stand they could.
Civilis at first attempted to induce them to disperse by treachery, and
when his attempts were unsuccessful fell upon them at the head of a
force composed of Canninefates, Frisians, and Batavians Owing to
the treachery of some ol the lately raised Gallie auxiliaries the Roman
forces were completely routed, and either slain or taken prisoners3 the
Gallie auxiliaries either stayed and joined the insurgente, or were sent
back to their homes with every mark of honour and distinction At
the same time the lieet which the Romans kept to patrol the Rhine
fell by the treachery of the rowers into the enemy's hands.

The Gerrnans on receipt of the news of this victory at once offered
their services to Civilis The Gauls hesitated longer3 a lengthened
period of peace, prosperity, and servitude had indisposed them to
revolt, and Civilis had to put forth all the arts of his eloquence before
thoy could be moved 3 even then they did not llock to his standards,
but an impression had been made upon them.

’Up to this point Hordeonius Flaccus had remained in Mainz a

passive spectator of events3 he now sends orders to Munius Lupercus,

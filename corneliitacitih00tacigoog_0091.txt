72 THE HISTORIES OF TACITUS sacr.

before the battle, points to the little confidence those generals com-
manded either with him or with his troops3 while the precipitancy
with which he forced on the final battle is at least as explicable on the
hypothesis that he wished to forestall the treachery of those about him,
ason the view adopted by Tacitus and Plutarch, that he was driven to
hurry it on by incapacity to bear the strain of suspense Of tlie obJect
with which the battle was undertaken 1 shall spealc in the next section.
The readiness with which, after the battle, the generals, not excluding
Otho's own brother Titianus, carne to terms with the enemyis proof
that their hearts were at most only half in the cause which they had
undertalen, and that they were ready to throw it over as soon as a
decent excuse for doing so presented itself ln· Mommsen’s view,
however, that Otho had no chance, after the defeat at Bedriacum, of
continuing the war, and that he committed suicide only when driven
to it by necessity, 1 am unable to concur. Otho had with him at
Brixellum a not inconsiderable force entirely devoted to his cause· 3
certainly not more than a portion ¹of the Illyrican legions had reached
the scene of action when the battle was fought, and the Moesian
forces were still in reserve. The pathos escape was yet open to
Otho, and he would have had no special difficulty in making his way
to join the forces, which were hastening to his rescue. Vespasian and
. the East ¹had not declared against him, nor was there any special reason

to think that they would do so. What motive prompted his death—
whether it was a genuine love of his country, a genuine desire, to, spare
fresh bloodshed, such as he claims for himself in the speech which
Tacitus puts into his mouth; whether it was mere weariness of life ;
or whether again he felt that he had thrust himself into a position
which he was unequal to support, is a problem which will always have
to remain unsolved Of the profound impression which his death
produced on the Roman world, cancelling in many minds the memories
of his earlier life, there can be no doubt, and Martial only givesa
somewhat exaggerated expression to a widelyspread sentiment when
he says (vi 32)— ·

> “Cum dubitaret adhuc belli civilis Enyo, .·
Forsitan et posset vincere mollis Otho,

Damnavit multo staturum sanguine Martem,
Et fodit certa pectora nuda manu.
’ Sit Cato dum vivit sane vel Caesare maior,
Dum moritur numquid maior Othone fuitl’'

. Tacitus’s study of the character of Vitellius is far less elaborate
than those of Galba and Otho, and Plutarch has not thought
him worthy of a separate study. Indeed his character was far
less interesting than that of either of his predecessors. In Galba we
have the tragedy of aman elevated in old age to a position to which
he was not equal, and failing just because he was unequal to it In
Otho, if 1 read his character aright, we have that of a man trying with

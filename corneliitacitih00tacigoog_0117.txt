98 THE HISTORIES OF TACITUS sacr.

Roman rule The soldiers’ attention was distracted by the sight of the
traitcr legions from Novesium, who, hiding themselves from the light
of day, mutely aslred for pardum This Cerialis granted them, and
brigading them with his own troops forbade his men to upbraid them
with what he was pleased to style their disasters lt was tothe dis
sensions that rent the Roman world that he attributed their previous
· fault
Meanwhile Civilis, Classicus, and Tutor were collecting forces to
meet him in the held. He might, Tacitus thinks, have crushed thern
in detail, but he preferred to wait their onset, contenting himself with
merely fortifying his camp on the other side of the Moselle, which had
’ been hitherto undefended. Civilis was for a policy of delay in order
to allow time for German reinforcements to arrive, but Tutor and
Classicus were for immediate action, and being the mayority carried the
day against him They advanced, the Ubii and Treveri in the centre,
the Batavian cohorts on the right, the Bructeri and Tencteri from across
the Rhine on the left wing. Cerialis was caught napping. The camp
which was on the other side of the river had been forced, the bridge
had been occupied, and the enemy were making their way ssinto the
town before he was awaltened from his sleep. To stay the fugitives,
to recover the bridge, to regain the camp, was tlre worlr of an instant.
Then he found the traitorous soldiers again hesitating, perhaps medi·
tatinga second act of treachery. Stemly he upbraids them and revives
their broken spirits, and helped by the arst legion, who had never
surrendered, he drives the enemy out of his own entrenchments, pur·
sues thern, and in turn captures and destroys their camp. Allowing
his soldiers no rest, he hurries them off to the rescue of the Agrippi·
· nenses, threatened by Civilis and his Batavian cohorts. He succeeded
in rescuing them; but in the West reverses overtook his arms, the Roman
lieet being routed and many of its ships captured by the Canninefates,
while on land this same people defeated the Nervii, who had taken up
arms in the Roman cause One more effort Civilis made before he
finally succumbed. Havin'g gathered what fresh forces he could in
Germany he encamped at Vetera, both as fumishing in itself a strong
position and also as the scene of his former victories Thither Cerialis
followed him, his forces now doubled by the arrival of the ad, the oth,
and the 14th legions, the first coming from Italy, tlre second from
Spain, the third from Britain Civilis had defended himself by flood·
ing the low-lying ground round Vetera, a manoeuvre which rendered the
Roman anach very difficolt In the first slrirmish the Germana, find·
. ingan advantage in the swampy ground, had the best of ir. But the
next day, when the battle was renewed, a Batavian deserter showed the
Roman cavalry a path by which the marslr could be circumvented, and
the Germans busily engaged in front were also suddenly attached in the
rear and were compelled to seelt safety by swimming the Rhine This
victory practically concluded the war. Civilis was foroed to seelt shelter,

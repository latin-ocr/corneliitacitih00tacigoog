first in his native island and then in the fastnesses and swamps north

of time At this point the narrative 01 Tacitus, as it has come down
to us, leaves him. ·

Various lessons were to be learnt from this interesting and
dangerous rising, which looked for a moment so near being successful
Some of them the Romans themselves learnt and applied

13, the first place the movement 31 Civilis pointed out the directiorr
from which danger was ultimately to be looked for 13 1133 Roman Empire,
and from which its destruction was finally to come The wealrness 31
1133 Roman system consisted in the possibility that its defendere and
subjects might turn against it, and without breaking up the empire might
constitute themselves its masters. This it was at which Civilis aimed3
something like this entered into the imagination 31 1133 Gallie leaders
Tutor, Classicus, and Sabinus But the danger was, as a matter of
fact, still 133 remote. It was the strength rather than the wealmess of
Rome which the insurrection really revealed. It was successful only ⁴
30 longas the issue who should rule Rome was still undecided;
directly this question was settled the revolt collapsed at once, and the
very soldiers who in the prospect of Vespasian’s rule had been driven
into mutiny, murder 01 113313 officers and desertion 01 113313 country,
when once he was established on the throne, recognised that further
resistance was helpless, and returned shame-striclren and unquestioning
to their allegiance, though they had to pay for their treachery by being
subsequently disbanded. ·
’ 13 1133 3330331 place the course 31 1133 revolt illustratet the inherent
wealrness of the Gauls and the extent to which Romanising influences
had already taken possession of the country. The weakness 01 Gaul
had been already shown in the revolt of Vindex. No national move
ment had even then been possible The North and East then held 31331
from a cause which originated in the South and West Now the parta
were reversed. It was the North and East who were this time the
aggressors, and the South and West refused to maire common cause
with them, and gave them instead the advice to return 33 quickly 33
possible to their allegiance and not to commit themselves to a course
which must eventually prove hopeless ,Nor was it internal dissensions
alone which thus paralysed the Gallic diet. Another and a well-
grounded fear was also present to their minda-the fear that even
should they succeed in stripping off the Roman yolre the only result
would be that they would fall speedy victims to the Germana Gaul
had not now and had not for many generations to come the strength
or the cohesion to stand alone. And between the two there was no
doubt wisdom 133 preferring the Roman to the German yoke The
Germana were still a horde of barbarians without culture, without
organisation, without political experience. From the Roman rule Gaul 2
13331 already reaped many advantages. Not only had internal peace

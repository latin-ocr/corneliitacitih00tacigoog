of previous foreign editors from Lipsius downwards 1 have
found abundant help, and my task has often been more that of
selection and arrangement than of original work. ln every
case, however, I have tried to exercise to the best of my ability
an independent Judgment. To the editors whose works I have
chiefly·consulted I have expressed my obligation in the chapter
on previous editionsof the Histories. I would only repeat here
what I have said there, that the present work could never have
been undertaken but for the help given by Ruperti and Ritter,
Orelli and Dr. Karl Heraeus. The text I have followed has
been that of Orelli (in the two earlier books his text as revised
by Meiser‚ in the three latter books the unrevised text of the
edition of 1848), and I have only ventured to depart from itin
a very few instances. Besides these works of the commentatore
I have also consulted with advantage on several points the
admirable Lm’con T aciteum of A. Gerber and Ἀ. Greef.

Ι Of works not directly bearing on the Historias I have
found most help ln the introductions to Mr. Fumeaux’s edition
of the Annals, which I have consulted on many points, Mad·

tlte Empire, and Professor Teuffel¹s Hr'story of Roman Literature.
Those whose wants I have had principally in mind in the
construction of the Commentary have been students at the
universities and boys in the higher forms of our public schools.
For the latter the Commentary may be thought somewhat fuller
and lengthier than ls needed. But 1 cannot but feel that scholar·
ship in England is suffering from the prevalence and general
use of what are called school editions of classical authors, the
object of which seems to be to boll down into the notes all the
information which is considered necessary to enable the boy to '
understand the text of his author, and not a word more. No
doubt the use of such manuals will enable a student to produce
the most satisfactory examination·papers on the subject, but it
does nothing to stimulate curiosity, to excite interest, to encour-

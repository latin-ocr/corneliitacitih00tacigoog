legate of the people and the senate of Rome He had no difficulty in
persuading the 6th legion and the population of the Tarraconensis to
espouse a cause which, in the provinces at any rate, the tyranny of
Nero inevitably made popular. H'e raised troops, convened a senate
of the leading men of the¹ province, and instituted for himself a body-
guard of youths of equestrian rank (Suet Life, c ro) When, however,
the insurrection in Gaul had proved entirely abortive, the army which
Vindex had collected had been shattered and destroyed by the legions
of Germany, and Vindex had confessed the failure of his enterprise by
his own suicide, Galba shrank from the rislr he had incurred and
. would fain again have returned to that condition of careless ease and
security which the steps he bad already taken·.had made for him
impossible The action meanwhile of others elsewhere had earned for
’ him an impunity and success which his own want of firmness and
resource had by no means merited Verginius in Gaul had refused to
receive the crown which the impetuosity of his victorious soldiers bad
again and again tried to force upon him, and had insisted on leaving
to the Senate and people of Rome the choice of who Nero’s successor
should be. In Rome itself Nymphidius Sabinus, copraefect of the prae-

tyrant whom they had long ceased to respect and now no longer feared
The news of Nero’s desertion by his soldiers, of his flight, and
subsequently of his death, and of the patriotic seli-renunciation of
Verginius, restored to Galba the confidence which bad at the crisis of
his fate forsalren him. As soon as messengers arrived notifying the
fact that he had been proclaimed on Nero’s death emperor by Senate

take possession in actual presence of the now-vacant throne

. Anived in Rome he proved a grievous disappointment to every
class and order in the community. The very soldiers he had brought
with him from Spain, already disgusted by the long march they had
been forced to make, resented his untimely attempts to maintain the
ancient discipline, had had their hearts stolen away from him on the
march by the courtly manners and friendly open ways of Salvius Otho,
and secretly murmured that they to whom he owed everything bad
received no adequate recognition or reward. The exasperation of the
praetorians, however, was much greater and more deeply rooted.
Nymphidius, after being mainly responsible for Nero's overthrow, had,
when he found himself supplanted in the command of the guard by
Laco, and his services but scantily recognised, determined to attempt

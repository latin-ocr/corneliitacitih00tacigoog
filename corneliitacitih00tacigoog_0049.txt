30 THE HISTORIES OF TACIYUS sucu.

teeming provinces, and there was probably no part of the Empim which
was so civilised a'nd so well off. Its inhabitants had, however, in the
midst of this material wealth and civilisation lost their former reputation
for courage, and Tacitus speaks in the most contemptuous terms of its
native levies (ii. ⁶9)ss “reddita civitatibus Gallorum auxilia, ingens
numerus et prima statim defectione inter inania belli adsumptus.” Only
one legion was quartered in Gaul at Lugdunum, and besides thisa
single cohort of Roman citizens and an ala of horse But the legions
of the Rhine were not far off3 and if their primary duty was to protect
the frontier against the Germana, they were scarcely less necessary in
order to aet as a checlr on the fickle population of the Gallie
provinces

Gaul lilre Spain owed its organisation to Augustus He divided
the whole country into four provinces. The first of them, Gallia
Narbonensis, was an extension of the old Provincia possessed by Rome
before the time of caesara conquesta. It included the coast-land and
the whole of Southem Gaul as far as the Alps-Provenee and Savoy.
Its capital was Narbo, situated on the Mediterranean considerably west
of Marseilles, indeed not very far from the Spanish frontier. The next
province had Lugdunum for its capital and was called from that fact
Lugdunensis 3 its population was predominantly Celtic It embraced,
roughly speaking, all the country from the valley of the Loire to that
of the Seine, Normandy and Brittany being included in it The third
province went by the old name of Aquitania It nowhere reached down
to the Mediterranean, but embraced besides the, district south of the
Garonne the country almost as far north as the left bank of the Loire.
It had for its capital Burdigala or Bordeaux, and its population was
prevailingly, though not exclusively,1berian Belgica, the fourth and
northern province, embraced all the country north and east of the
Seine3 its population was mainly German; its capital was Augusta
Treverorum (or Treves), situated not far from its north-eastern fronticr.
The three last provinces were sometimes contrasted with the first by
the collective name of Gallia Comata. Gallia Narbonensis was a
senatorial province, the three others were Caesariau. ,

These four provinces differed from one another not only in the

predominaut character os their population but also in their internal
organisation, the contrast being, however, most marked between the
first and the other three. In Gallia Narbonensis, as in Spain, there

existed a large number of Roman and Latin colonies, founded some of
them by Julius Caesar, some by Augustus, some by later emperors

Narbo, founded originally by C Gracchus but enlarged by Caesar, Forum
'Julii, and Arelate near the mouth of the Rhone, received full rights
of Roman citizenship. Nemausus and its territory, Ruscino, Avennio,
Aquae Sextiae, and Apta, acquired all of thern latin rights. Indeed
the people of this part of Gaul became to all intents aud purposes
Roman, capable, if they quitted their own homes and left a representative

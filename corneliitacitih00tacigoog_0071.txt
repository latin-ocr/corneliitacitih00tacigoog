For the reason already given, Asia took very little part in the wars
oi 69 nm- Like Achaia, it was frigbtened by the appearance of the
pretended Nero. Like the rest oi the East it early joined Vespasian's
cause, bringing to it wealth and supplies, but adding little to its strength
in men (ii. 81). The little we hear about it in the Historiis contrasts
somewhat curiously with the prominence which it has in the more peace·
lul times described in the Annals, when its affairs form a subject ol
prominent and constant debate in the Senate

(a) Bithynia, like Asia, came to the Romans by inheritance lt
was lelt to them by Nicomedes, its last king. Pontus was annexed to
it after the conquest os Mithridates by Pompey. Bithynia and Pontus
between them occupied the greater part oi the southern coast os the
Euxine. Bithynia, when the Romans took it over, was sar less civilised
and Hellenised than was Asia It was also a less rich and prosperous v
district. Under Roman administration the country greatly advanced
Its chief towns—Nicaea, Nicomedia, Prusa, Juliopolis-grew to wealth
and importance, and it produced some important writers, the most note·
worthy being Dio, the philosopher of Prusa, Arrianus oi Nicomedia,
Dio Cassius ol Nicaea Pontus was a wilder and less civilised district
than Bithynia proper. Its chief towns were Amasia, Amisus, and
Sinope 3 the last, a town oi considerable importance, made a Roman
colony by Julius Caesar. Besides these a number os cities were
founded in the interior, but they did not greatly thrive. Trapezus, the
station of the Roman lieet on the Black Sea, was not in Pontus proper
but beyond its borders in Cappadocian Pontus, but the lact that the
fleet was stationed there made it a place of importance It was the
presence oi the fleet at Trapezus which kept the whole coast in order;
accordingly, when the ships were withdrawn by Mucianus to accompany
him on his expedition into Italy, Anicetus, a freedman ol Polemo, who
under Nero had rnled the kingdom ol Westem Pontus, seized the oppor-
tunity to raise the natives os the Pontic coast and to make a raid on
Trapezus itseli The insurrection had, however, onlya brief success. -
As soon as Vespasian heard of it he despatched Virdius Geminus, a
tried soldier, to suppress it, who succeeded without much difficulty in

⁴ chastising the unruly tribes and capturing Anicetus, the author oi the

outbreak (iii. 47, 48). Bithynia and Pontus were at this nane ruled by
a senatorial governor, but were shortly aller taken over by the emperor
in exchange lor the less important districtos Pamphylia and Lycia

(3) Cappadocia still ranked as an unarmed province, ie. it had
no permanent force ol troops stationed within it (ii. 81). It had been
made a province only in the year 17 AD. under Tiberius (Ann. ii 42,
5⁶) on the death ol its king, Archelaus Being on the borders oi the·
Empire the emperor kept it in his own hands3 it was govemed by an
imperial procurator. lt embraced a very wide extent ol country, reach-

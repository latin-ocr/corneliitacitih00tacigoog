r3th had a private grievance of their own, having been told off by
Vitellius to build amphitheatres at Cremona and Bononia After the
proclamation of Vespasian a council of war was held at Pettau in the
valley of the Drave, the headquarters of the r3th legion, to decide on
their course of action. In this Antonius Primus pleaded eamestly for
prompt measures, an immediate advance He undertoolr if he were
allowed only the cavalry and the light-armed forces to make his vray into
Italy, and open a road for the legions who might follow at their ease.
To this plan the soldiers rather than the leaders gave their assent, and
Antonius set out on his hazardous march, taking with him as his col-
league Arrius Varus, the leading centurion apparently of the yth legio'n.
Before starting Antonius sent orders to the Moesian legions to join him
as quiclrly as possible, and took measures for the defence of the frontier
by' mcorporating in his force some of the Sarmatian chiefs and cavalry,
hy whom rts tranquillity might be threatened At the same time some
cavalry and some native Norican militia were told off to hold the
valley of the Inn, and to guard the right flank against Porcius Septi·
minus, the procurator of Raetia, a staunch adherent of Vitellius.

The Alps in this eastern portion are not difficult to cross, and a good
military road led over them connecting Pannonia with Italy. Adwancing
along this road Antoniusand Arrius Varus speedily found themselves
at Aquileia, and were received by it and hythe neighbouring towns
and villages with open arms. The first brush between them and the
enemy occurred alter they had reached Patavium or Padua. Here
news was brought them that a picket of the enemy were encamped at
no great distance at a place called Forum Alieni, where they were
holding a bridge over the Adige or one of the other tributaries of the
Po. This picket Antonius's cavalry succeeded in surprising without
difficulty; some were cut down on the spot, some escaped, some
deserted. On receipt of the news of this first success the 7th (Galbiana),
Antonius's own legion, and the r3th at once hurried up and overtook
the advance-guard before they had quitted Patavium. Here a short
halt was made, during which Antonius toolr the judicious step of having
the images of Galba replaced in Patavium and the neighbouring towns,
that he might procure for his enterprise, as it were, the sanction of that
still revered name At Patavium it was resolved that Verona should
be their next point of attach, as the open fields in its neighbourhood ,
were favourable for the operations of cavalry in which their strength
mainly consisted, and the wealth and strength of Verona itself would
contribute, if they succeeded in capturing it, not a little to their cause.
Nor did Verona itself offer any resistance, but together with the
neighbouring village of Vicetia (Caecina’s hirthplace, as they noted)
passed without a struggle into their hands The possession of Verona
enabled them to intercept any reinforcemonts who might be coming to ’
Vitellius by way of Raetia and the Julian Alps, and was thus of great
strategical' importance to them (iii. r -.8)

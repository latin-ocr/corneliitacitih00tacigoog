to them in the same way as the legions of Spain and Britain were
subordinate to those of the Rhine ’³ (Mommsenl The legions forming
the army of Pannonia at this time were the 13th and the yth Galbiana
They espoused at once the cause of Otho (i. 76) and sent forward
detachments to join him at Brixellum (ii. 11); they seem to have corne
up soon enough to take a part in the battle of Bedriacum (ii. 86).
After the battle tire 7th were dismissed to their winter quarters, but the
13th were retained for a tirne in Italy to assist in the construction
of amphitheatres at Cremona and Bononia (ii ⁶7)· It was with these
legions that the movement in Europe for setting Vespasian on the
throne originated Antonius Primus, the prime author of it, succeeded
in fust winning over to the cause his own legion, the yth, and the
13th shortly afterwards ioined him Both legions smarted under their
recent defeat at Bedriacum, and the ‘¹3th resented their employment
on the works at Cremona and Bononia A conference of leaders was
held shortly afterwards at Poetovio, and it was then decided that an
immediate advance should be made into Italy. T. Ampius Flavianus, ,
the consular commender of the district, offered no opposition‚ and
Antonius Primus taking with him the cavalry and cohorts of the allies
commenoed his march at once (iii. 6). At Patavium the two legions
dame up with him (iii. 7) (news of a preliminary victory in a skirmish
having already reached thern) and advanced with him to Verona
Both took part in the second light at Bedriacum and in the subsequent
siege and sack of Cremona, and the yth especially distinguished itself.
Both legions accompanied Antonius and Mucianus in their march to
Rome, and shared in the fighting in and around the capital. The
γὼ, however, regarded with jeelousy by Mucianus on account of its
devotion to Antonius, was in the course of the winter sent back to its
quartem in Pannonia (iv. 39). The 13th seems to have gone back
some little time later.

(3) The province of Moesia was occupied by Augustus in
order to keep in check the barbarous and predatory tribes that lay
beyond the Danube. The district itself, the Ripa Thraciae, as it was
called, belonged to tribes not of the Albanian but of the Thracian
stock It was bounded on the north by the Danube, on the west by
Pannonia, on the east by the Euxine; from Thrace, Macedon, and
Illyria, it was separated by the ranges of Haemus and Scardus. It
comprised what is now Servia and Bulgaria' The Romans had donc
at this time little to civilise the country, and it was rather a district
commanded and controlled by standing camps than a province. Like
Pannonia and Dalmatia, the emperor kept the control of it directly in
his own hands. The country had been conquered without any very
great difficulty, but the restlessness and predatory habits of the tribes

on the bther side'of the Danube, the Rhoxolani, Jazyges, Daci, and
Getae, made the defence of the frontier a task of difficulty, and necessi-
tated the keeping up of a large force for the purpose. Three legions

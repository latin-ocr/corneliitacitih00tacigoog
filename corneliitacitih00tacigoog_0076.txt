rv INTRODUCTION bl

has been already stated, the eastern and fertile portion of Cilicia was
on the formation oi the province of Lycia and Pamphylia incor-
porated with Syria for administrativa purposes, and increased the re
sources of the province. The eastern frontier of the province was, as
lar as possible, defended against the incursions os the Bedouin tribes
by the establishment of a chain ol forts and the creation of a series of
more or less independent kingdoms, Chalcis and Iturea on the north,
the kingdom os the Nabateans on the south. The latter was at this
time a thriving state under the rule os Maiehus, son ol the Aretas
mentioned in St Paul’s Epistles Its capital was Petra, and its
‘dominicus extended as far as Damascus on the north, and embraced
the upper part of the Arabian peninsula on the south. It grew rich
by means os the considerable caravan trade which passed through its
bordera

Syria played a great and even a decisive partin the events recorded
in the Historias. The four legions by which at this time the country
was occupied were the 3d Gallica, the ath Scythica, the 6th Ferrata,
and the rath Fulminatrin Ol these legions, however, the 3d was
apparently quite early in the year moved into Moesia, and there took
the lead in proclaiming Vespasian emperor (ii 85). The commender
os the legions and governor oi the province was Marcus Licinius
Crassus Mucianus, a member os the great house ol the Crassi Liciniani
He had in early youth striven to rise by cultivating the friendships ol
the great (la i ιο). He had even counted Messalina among his patrons.
Claudius had maome Jealous ol him, and banished him to the depths
of Asia Under Nero he had been permitted to retum to Rome, and
had risen apace He had been consul in 66 ab, and the next year
had been appointed to the command os Syria Tacitus describes him
as a mixed character, one with respect to whom it was difficult to say .
whether his virtues or his vices predominated

In the proclamation ol Galba and of Otho as emperors Mucianus
seems to have acquiesced, and had formally given in his adhesion to
Otho (i. 76); but when Vitellius proved the victor at Bedriacum
neither his own incli tion nor the eagemess ol his soldiers allowed
him to remain quiessnt (ii 6). The liast could not brook that
the armies ol the West should have the preeminence unchal·
lenged, and force-,² their nominee on the Roman world. He held
through Titus communications with Vespasian, at that time in
command in Judaea Unable at last to resist any longer the im-
petuosity ol his troops, he takes the decisive step and openly calls
on Vespasian to undertake the responsibilities os Empire (ii 76).
The two had met ‘at Berytus. Retuming thence to his province
he entered the theatre at Antioch and announced to the assembled
people that the soldiers oi Judaea had taken the lead in proclaiming
their commender emperor. The whole province, including the subject
kings, took lire at once and threw themselves heartily into the cause.

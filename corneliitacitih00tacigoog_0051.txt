32 THE HISTORIES OF TACITUS sacr.

¹chief business of the North and West It was at a much later date
than that which we have now reached that the cultivation of the vine
spread to the banks of the Moselle. ’

The capital of the three northern provinces was Lugdunum or
Lyons, situated at the junction of the Rhone and Saline. This was the
place at which the emperor if he visited Gaul usually resided; to it
converged all theroads by which ¹the country was traversed Here was
stationed the small force which was considered sufficient to lreep the
whole country in subjection3 here was erected the altar to the genius
of Rome and the emperor, at which sacrifices were yearly offered and
games celebrated which formed the Roman hearth of the whole country 5

, here, above all, met the diet of the three Gauls in yearly consultation.
This diet consisted of sixtyfour members, one representative from each
of the sixtyfour cantons or tribes into which the country was divided.
What its exact powers and functions were we have no precise informa-
tion, but it seems to have had some power of assessing or distributing
taxes in all three provinces3 it received statements of grievances and
forwarded thern to the Roman authorities; lastly‚ it exercised a certain
superintendence over local affairs Lugdunum, as the Roman centre of
the whole country, occupied a position apart It was founded ditect
from Rome, and its original inhabitants were mainly full Roman
citizens It was itselfa Roman colony free from taxation‚ but sending
no representative to the diet of the Gauls, since it counted as Roman
rather than Gallie In eager rivalry with it was the town of Vienna

planted on the other side of the Rhone This, situated just within the
confines of the province, had had Roman or Latin rights conferred on
it by Caius. The acquisition of such a distinction had only increased
its rivalry with Lyons; and when Valens visited Lyons in 69 ab. the
enmity of the two places had reached such a point that either city was
prepared to go any length to effect the ruin of its competitor (H. i. 6 5).
Outside Lyons and the limits of the province very few Gallie states
had even by this date received Roman or' even Latin rights Ara
Ubiorum, or Colonia Agrippinensis (Cologne)‚ and Augusta Treve
rorum (Treves) had been made indeed Latin colonies, but this
bestowal of such rights on states was of comparatively rare occur·
rence, though the acquisition of them by individuals was extremely
frequent. Augustus, moreover, had passed adecree excluding Gauls,
even if they had received Latin rights, from eligibility to office, and
consequently from eligibility to the Senate. Claudius had, however,
done away with these restrictions and had thus opened a political
career at Rome to all those Gauls, who for military service, or for any
other cause, once acquired Roman or Latin rights (Ann. xi. 23⁴5)-
Galba seems to have gone a step farther and conferred the franchise
wholesale on the members of those tribes who had most prominently
supported the cause of Vindex (H. i. 8). Such seems to have been
tbe position of affairs with respect to the franchise in Gaul at the

The capital of the whole country and second city in the Empire
was Alexandria It was inhabited mainly by Greeks and by Jews Its
free population amounted at the end of the rule of the lagidae to
300‚ooo 3 under the Roman Empire it reached a still higher total.
Its situation, less beautiful than that of Antioch, was far more favourable
for commerce, and its actual commerce was far greater. The popula-
tion of the town was quiclr-witted and turbulent—as quiclr·witted as
that of Antioch and more turbulent. Constant feuds raged between
the Greeks and the Jews, of whom there was also a large colony in the
city, feuds which not unfrequently broke out into actual street-wara
One of the most remarkable features in Alexandria was the great liter-
ary society which congregated there, having its centre in the Museum.
This society produced indeed not much first-rate original work, but
an infinite amount of laborious learning, systematisation, and research.
It organised, analysed, and reproduced the earlier original literature of
Greece, and added to it not a little in the way of physical science and
of ingenious speculation. ,

The force¹ which controlled the country in 69 am. consisted of two
legions, the aad} Deiotariana and the gd Cyrenaica Its prefect was
Tiberius Alexander, himself a Jew by descent He had previously been
procurator of Judaea He seems to have accepted without scruple the
accession of Galba, nor did he move against Otho when he ascended
the throne (i. 76). As soon, however, as Vespasian became a candi·
date for the Empire he threw himself heartily into his cause, and it
was at Alexandria that Vespasian was first proclaimed emperor on rst
July. That was counted as the birthday of the new reign (it 79).
Vespasian, as he have already seen, selected Alexandria as the scene
of his own operations in the events which followed. His object was
viii. 48) to hold it and also Africa, and so, possessed of both the main
com-supplies, to starve the city into submission At Alexandria he
received the news of the victory of Bedriacum or Cremona There he
remained during the winter, and through the spring and summer of .
70, until the Etesian winds were over; there he performed those
strange miracles which seem among the best attested of cures wrought
by the mere effect ol faith in the recipients of them. Apparently after
his departure from Alexandria some of the army stationed there was
despatched to reinforce Titus, who was just preparing for his final
effort in the Judaic war (v. 1).

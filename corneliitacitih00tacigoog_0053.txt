had been long strangera Their recent easy victory and the junction
of the two armies served at the same time to inspire tbem with an
overwhelming sense of their own strength and prowess Galba they
despised, partly because they saw in him only the successor of Vindex,
partly because he was the representative of the Spanish army which
was greatly their inferior. .

It was at the prompting of such feelings as these that the two
armies of the Rhine shortly after the first of January ioined in proclaim·
ing Vitellius, commender of the Lower army, emperor. On his procla-
mation the tribes of Eastem Gaul, the Lingones and Treveri, declared
at once in his favour-nutstripping even the soldiers themselves in their
real and enthusiasm.. On the other hand the march of Valens through
Gaul with forty thousand soldiers of the army of Lower Germany at
his back was the march of a conqueror through a conquered country.
At every stage, indeed the people hastened to make their peace with
him and with his disorderly soldiery, but they made it only at the cost
of large bribes and plentiful supplies of provisions. Vienna, though a
Roman or a Latin colony, narrowly escaped destruction, and had to
beg its safety from the troops and their officere The soldiers con·
sidered that they were now reaping the fruits of their victory over
Vindex, and Valens made use of their feelings to enrich and to gratify
himself. At Lyons the army was joined by the rst legion and the
ala Tauriana stationed there, and a single cohort of Roman citizens
was teu to guard a country which felt at least as much aversion to
Vitellius as to Otho, though it feared him more Caecina’s march took
him less directly through Gaul, but his treatment of the Helvetii provee
that he and his soldiers were not inclined to regard the provincials
with any greater favour or leniency than were their comradee of the
lower army (i. 63·66, 6769).

In the actual conflict between Vitellius and Otho Gaul threw itseif

· heartily neither on the one side nor the other. The descent of Otho's
troops on the district of the Maritima Alps was intended, no doubt,
to have the effect of raising Southem Gaul in his muse, and Valens
¹found it necessary to detach a part of his troops to guard against such
a danger. But no native rising took place, and the expedition from
this point of view proved a complete failure. When Vitellius started
southward he carried with him the majority of the troops destined to
guard the Germanfrontier. Their place had to be supplied by levies
hastily raised in Gaul itself (ii 57). As he advanced thmugb Gaul the
news met him that his soldiers had been successful at Bedriacum, and
that his rival Otho had put himself to death Vitellius even on receipt
of the news did not venture to send back to their quarters the troops
that accompanied him; they were bent on sharing with those who had
gone before the prizes of war and the enjoyments of Italy, and had
no mind to return to their northern homes So they continued to
advance by land while Vitellius himself floated idly and luxuriously

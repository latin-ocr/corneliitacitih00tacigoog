age inquiry, to call out judgment and intelligence, and so it lails
as an instrument os education. Ol the many imperfections in
my own Commentary, the superfluities on some points, the
shortcomings on others, 1 am deeply conscious; but l have
tried to put into the notes whatever seemed to me really illus·
trative os the subject, and to indicate as sar as I could (sor
Tacitus’s language is sometimes a riddle) the author’s actual‘
meaning. The work has been a labour os love, sor 1 value
Tacitus alilre sor his wit and sor his wisdom; for the true
things he says and the matchless way in which he says them.
ln the introductory chapters Ι have attempted to discuss the
questions of greatest importance arising out ol or connected
with the Hr’storr'es. I hope they may add something to the
interest os the book and to the right understanding of the
history.

ln conclusion, I have only to aclmowledge my debt os
gratitude to my friends and colleagues, Mr. P. E. Matheson
and Mr. A H. Cruiclrshank, for the help they have given me

by revising the prool'·sheets; and also to express my hearty
thanks to my printers, Messrs. R. and R. Clark, of Edinburgh,
sor many valuable corrections and hints which they and their
readers have furnished while the work has been passing through
the Press

4 THE HISTORIES ¹OF TA CITUS sacr.

themselves to later editors, and there is probably no single editor
except Lipsius who has done so much as Pichena to place the text ol
Tacitus in a satisfactory and intelligible condition

Not much later than ·Pichena’s edition was the lirst important
English work on Tacitus Sir Henry Savile published in 1612 a trans·
lation ol the whole ol the extant books ol the Annals, together with the
Gemany,· and in a second volume the first four books ol the Historias
and the Life af Agricola. This moad volum'e he quaintly entitled
Tlta end ιγ’ Naro aad llta beglnm'ng of Galba: Faura Baaks af tlte
Iitilata'es aad tlte Agn'cola of Cornelius Tacitus. The first part ol the
title was due to the lact that he introduced by way ol prelace to the
translation ol the Historias an account ol the rising ol Vindex, the
proclamation of Galba, and the death oi Nero, taken mainly hom the
works ol Dio and Suetonius At the end ol each chapter in the His·
larris he has added notes, mainly antiquarian and historical, showing
constantly a wide learning and much ingenuity. The translation, com-
posed in the racy English ol his time, is generally lree and readable,
though not always exact in point os scholarship.

In the course os the seventeenth century there appeared a variety ol
works on Tacitus, mainly by Dutch and French scholam. Perhaps the
most noteworthy editions are those ol J. F. Gronovius, published at
Leyden in ¹⁶72 (this was reedited and republished by his sons some
years later) ς and that of Ryckius, also published at Leyden in 1687.
Gronovius, lor the purposes oi his edition, collated the tvo Oxlord
MSS, which seem hitherto to have escaped the notice ol scholare,
while Ryckius largely drew upon a Codex ol Rudolphus Agricola

During the course of the eighteenth century two fresh English
translations ol Tacitus saw the light. The first was by various hands,
Dryden being the most important contributor to it; the second by T. ¹
Gordon,a friend and contemporary ol Sir Robert Walpole, to whom
the work was dedicated. Gordon supplemented his translation bya
series ol political essays, suggested more or less by Tacitus's writings,
which contained a good deal ol the Whig doctrine lashionable at the
time Indeed it was lor the sake ol his supposed Whig philosophy that
Gordon seems to have been principally attracted to Tacitus Gordon's
translation is somewhat cumbrous and involved, but generally accurate.

The earliest annotated English edition ol which 1 am able to find
arecord was by Homer, Fellon oi Emanuel College, Cambridge, pub
lished in london in 1790. Homeffs edition is mainly critical, but it
contains also a very lull index ol Tacitean words and phrases, com·
pleted alter his death by his two brothers. The next English edition
was Valpys, which appeared in 1834. Valpy’s, however, does not
proless to be an original work, but is merely a translation, as sar as the
notes are concemed, ol the work oi the French scholar Brotier, pub
lished in Paris in 1771. This edition oi Brotier, besides containing
a copious apparatus allana, has many geographical and antiquarian

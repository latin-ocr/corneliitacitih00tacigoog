48 THE HISTORIES OF TACIYUS secr.

at present occupied the dismct, the 3d Gallica lately brought thither
from Syria, the yth Claudia, and the 8th Augusta Its ruler was M.
Aponius. The Moesian legions, like the Pannonian, early accepted
Otho as emperor (i 7⁶)· Almost immediately after ins accession they
were called upon to repel an invasion oi the tribes living on the other
side of the Danube (i. 79). This they were able to effect without any
great loss on their own part; the liberality with which on this occasion
Otho rewarded their services tended to confirm them in hearty loyalty
to him. They readily obeyed Otlro's summons to join him in the
plains of the Po, and advanced as far as Aquileia on their march into
Italy. Unfortunately for him the impatience of Otho did not give
them time to reach Bedriacum, and hearing of the ruin oi the cause
they had adopted they returned from Aquileia into their winter quarters
(ii. 85). Before returning home they broke into and plundered their
militagv chest The fear of punishment for this offence made them the
more eager to espouse the cause of Vespasian, and even before the
Pannonian and Dalmatian forces had moved they had already sworn
allegiance to his cause. The gd, recently arrived from Syria, took the
lead, as was natural, in thus acting. When Antonius marched into
Italy they hastened at once to join him (iii. 9, ro), and took their part
in the fighting which followed, in the battle of Bedriacum, and in the
sack oi Cremona With Antonius they marched on to Rome From
Rome the gd legion was sent back into Syria by Mucianus, who feared
thern as the ardent supporters of Arrius Varus (iv. 39); tlte yth seems
to hare returned to its quarters in Moesia, while the 8tlr was sent off to
support Domitian and Cerialis in Gaul (iv. 68). While the legions
were absent in Italy, the exposed district was threatened by the Dacians,
who had already captured the minor forts hy which the bank of the
Danube was defended, and were preparing to attack the camps of the
legions when Mucianus ordered up the 6th legion and succeeded with
its help in effectually'clreeking them (iii 46).

of the Pannonian revolt (6-9 nn), though the Thraeians generally
ioined the insurgents. Iu spite of many uprisings and disturbances
the country was allowed to remain under its native princes till the
year 4⁶ nn, when Claudius reduced it to a regular province Like
Macedonia and Achaia it was by Claudius handed over to the Senate,
since it did not reckon as a frnntier district, nor was any standing
army kept within it Though the interior remained practically un·
subdued, and the task of civilisIng the population went on in these
districts but slowly, there were thriving cities, chiefly of Greek origin,
scattered along the coast3 and the population being brave and warlilte
fumished a large number of recruits to the Roman army, the names of
Thracians being found in inscriptions in all parts of the Empire.

12 THE HISTORIES OF TA CITUS itaer.

respect to which he may not have gleaned from the accounts of eye·
witnesses

5 1. Tacitus vas himself from fourteen to fifteen years old when
the events recorded in the first four books of his Historias took place.
The work itself was composed from twenty-five to thirty years later,
but the design of writing it had probably been formed earlier, and
materials which were subsequently to be made use of may have been
collected over a period of many years Those fifteen hateful years of
Domitian’s reign, blotted out, as he himself says (Ag. 3), from the
span of his active life, may have been iu p'art spent in committing
to writing the recollections of an earlier time, since to forget is not
equally easy with being silent It is almost certain that Tacitus, ifnot
actually born in Rome, received his education there, rather earlier than,
but under the same masters as, his friend, the younger Pliny (Plin Epp.
vii πο, 4 ; iv. 13, 113 Dial a). He must therefore have witnessed
as boy or youth some of the most stirring of the events which he
describes in the Hr'stors‘es, and he may well have written accounts ol
many of them while they were still fresh in his memory.

Of Galba's entry into Rome, and the unfavourable impression
produced by his massacre of the Classiarii, Tacitus writes as of
events which he had witnessed and recollected. Much more decisively
is this the case with the proclamation of Otho in the camp of the
praetorians3 and with Galba's subsequent descent in his litter “into the
Forum, where the temples and basilicas were filled on all sides witha
sad and expectant crowd.” Who but an eye-witness could have told
how “the people and plebs uttered no word, but stood with awestruck
countenances, their ears open to catch every sound ;'' how “there was
neither tumult nor peace but the silence of a great fear, a great anger ;''
or have described the mad rush of the infuriated soldiery into the
Forum, the hasty ilight of the people, the swords drawn against all who
showed signs of hesitation or resistance (i 40, 41)? But at this point
most likely Tacitus himself fled; there is no ground for believing that
he witnessed the death of Galba, or of Vinius, or of Piso. The details
in each case are given rather on the authority of others than as the
result of his own observations.

To none of the speeches which are interspersed through this part of
the narrative can Tacitus himself have listened. Thataddressed by Galba
to Piso on his adoption was heard by so small an audience that Tacitus
can scarcely have received more than the barest drall of it; nor do the
words with which be introduces it imply that he was giving any very exact
account of what was actually said (“Galba-in hunc modum locutus
fertur,’' i. 15). Piso’s speech addressed to the cohort on guard in the
palace, Otho's to the praetorians in their camp, as both were matters of
greater notoriety, are probably both of them more accurately reproduced 3
and Tacitus seems to claim a higher authority for them. (“Piso-in

hunc modum adlocutus est,'' i. 29. ‘⁸ Otho—ita coepit,'’ i 3⁶·)

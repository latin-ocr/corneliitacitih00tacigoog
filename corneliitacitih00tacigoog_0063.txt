province govemed by s procurator, had no standing army quartered
in it, but was protected by its own natIve troops and militia. The
legion stationed at Vindonissa served to keep it in check, and it had
at the time of its original conquest been deprived by the Romans
of a considerable proportion of its inhabitants It was conquered in
16 and 15 sc by Drusus and Tiberius, the adopted sons of Augustus,
and owed its organisation as a province to the first emperor. It
embraced within its limits Eastem Switaerland and the western portion
of the Tyrol, the northern slopes of the more easterly chain of the
central Alps. In the period before us it played an early part in the
Civil War. It ioined Vitellius immediately on hearing of his proclama·
tion, and when Caecina was advancing into Italy and proposed to attack
the Helvetii on his vray, he appealed to the native Ievies of Raetia to
aid him in hIs enterprise by falling on the rear of the enemy while he
attacked thern in front. The Raeti listened only too readily to his
commands, and were not a little instrumental in procuring for him the
easy victory which he obtained (i. 67). At a later time when Antonius
Primus, Vespasian's general, was advancing at the head of the Illyrian
forces into Italy, Raetia under its procurator, Porcius Septimius,
faithful to Vitellius, threatened his right flank The neighbouring
province of Noricum was, however, favourable to the Flavianist cause,
and its militia, together with an ala Auriana despatched by Antonius to
its assistance, was sufficient to hold in check the forces of the Raetian
governor (iii 5). Still the fact that the Vitellians kept the command
of Raetia was an important element in the situation, since it made easy
the forwarding of reinforcements from Germany into Italy (iii. 8, 14)·
Vindelicis, embracing the country north and east of the Lake of
Constance as far as the Upper Danube, was annexed to the Empire
just at the same time with Raetia, and also received its organisation
from Augustus, 14 sc It perhaps at this tIme formed a part or dis·
trict of Raetia ; at any rate it nowhere appears as taking independent
action The Romans seem to have valued it chiefly as providing a
neutral territory between themselves and the tribes of Germany. Its
capital and only important town was Augusta vindelicorum (now Auga-
burg). This Tacitus praises in the Germany asa prosperous and thriv·
ing town, situated in the midst of a fertile and well-tilled district.
But the prosperity of the city would seem to have dated rather from
the reign of Domitian than from the period we are now considering.
The last of the Italian frontier provinces was Noricum, lying
between Raetia and Vindelicis on the west, and Pannonia on the
east, bounded on the north by the Danube aud on the south partly by
Northem Italy, partly by Dalmatia. It embraces a good deal of what
is now German Austris. This region, which yielded to the Romans
almost without a struggle, received its organisatIon like Raetis and
Vindelicis¹ from Augustus. It differed, however, in its subsequent
development considerably from them. It was far more accessible than

The two Greek provinces of Macedonia and Achaia playa very
subordinate part in the Historias. Both had no army, both vere ruled
by senatorial govemors In both Rome leit untouched as iar as
possible the earlier' Greek organisation which prevailed when she
conquered them; she made no serious attempt to introduce the Latin
language or Roman customs among thern Macedonia was no longer
as important as it had been under the Republic With the formation
oi the provinces oi Pannonia and Moesia its governor vas relieved os
all care lor the protection of the frontier. Achaia was in the year
27 nc. taken imm it and made a separate administrative district, and
the neighbouring tribes to the north which had given trouble under
the Republic were now finally subdued That which gave Macedonia
such importance as it still retained vas its position on the main road .
between east and west Its port, Dyrrhachium, was the usual portos ’
disembarkation lor travellers bound eastvard, while the Via Egnatia
which traversed the whole country formed the most ordinary route os
communication between Rome and ber Eastem possessione Along
this road' lay the most important colonies which the country pos
sessed. Dyrrhachium itself had a considerable trade5 Thessalonica,
the capital oi the country, rechoned almost as one os the great cities
of the Empire; Philippi, the centre oi the gold-mining district, was
aplace ol wealth and consideration. The only considerable town not
on the Egnatian road was Stobi, situated at the junction ol the Erigon
and Axius. Eoonomically the country seems to have languished under
tbe Empire, but its people lurnished many recruits to the Roman army
and more particularly to the imperial guard ’

Achaia, which included Thessaly and the afterwards separated
district of Epirus, was like Macedonia an unarmed and a senatorial
province Fora while, indeed, Tiberius, at the request os the inhabitants,
had taken over both provinces into his own hands3 but Claudius had
restored them to the Senate and witb the Senate they still remained.
Tbe policy oi Augustus, adopted also by his successors, was to allow
the Greeks as much liberty as was compatible with the salety ol the
Empire and the maintenance ol order vithln the district itself. The
old Delphic Amphictyony vas reconstituted under Augustus, being
made to embrace within it Epirus, with its newly-rounded capital
Nicopolis, and Macedon, as well as the older states Athens and
Sparta vere created into free cities, exempted from tribute, and allowed
to manage their own affairs, elect their own magistrates, and assess
their own taxes Similar privileges were conferred on the communities
of free laconians, on Dyme and Patrae. Corinth, relounded by Julius
Caesar, was made into a Roman colony, and became the capital ol
the whole province and the residence oi the Roman proconsul. On

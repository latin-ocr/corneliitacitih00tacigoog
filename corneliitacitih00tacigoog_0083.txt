64 THE HISTORIES OF TACITUS secr.

than on those of the three emperors who succeeded one another

within the space of a few months 3 and their characters were such as
to fumish in many respects an excellent foil one to the other. To
some extent we are able to check the sketches he has left for us,
for in the case of all three we have the parallel lives of Spetonius,
compiled, it would seem, from independent sources, different from
those of which Tacitus has mainly made use, and for the first two we
have the elaborate studies of Plutarch as well Plutarch, it is true,
seems in the main to have followed the same authorities which Tacitus
employed, but he basin many respecta supplementedTacitus’s account,
and represents a point of view somewhat different from his
Lucius Sulpicius Servius Galba (for such seems to have been his
name in full) was in many respecta a typical Roman aristocrat He
carne of a distinguished family both on his fatheds and his mortiers
side, and is said to have been himself not a little Proud of his ancestry,
putting up in his hall after he became emperor a pedigree which traeed
back on his fathers side his descent to Jove, on his mother's to
Pasiphae, wife of Minos. The Sulpician house from which he was .
sprung had indeed contributed many distinguished names to the
service of the Roman state. One of bis ancestors had conducted
with success tbe first Macedonian war, another had distinguished
himself, partly indeed for his cruelty, in ·Spain; bis great-grandfather

mother, Mummia Achaica by name, was tbe granddaughter of Caius
Lutatius Catulus, the last great princeps scachis, the most respected of
all names under the late Republic; her great-grandfather was Mummius,
the destroyer of Corinth. It was no doubt in part this distinguished
descent which led Vindex to single out Galba for the dangerous
distinction of Nero’s proposed successor, and which led the Senate
on Nero’s death to acquiesce in the choice made by this comparatively
· obscure provincial rebel Nor had Galba's own previous career been
unworthy of the great ancestry from which be was sprung. -Tbere is a
story told, though with considerable variatione in detail, that in his early
youth either Augustus or Tiberius had predicted of him that he was
destined one day to enjoya brief taste of empire (See Tae Ann. vi ao ;
Jos. Ant. xviii. 6; Dio, lvii. 19 3 Suet Galb 4.). He devoted himself
at first to the service of Livia, with whom he was connected through
his father’s second marriage, and gained through her influence his earliest
advance. in public life. After holding the praetorship before the legal
age, and distinguishfng himself in it by introducing to the Roman
public the novel spectacle of elephants performing on the tight mpe,

behind them, of pushing their fortunes and rising to any position in

the Roman state Throughout the district the old cantonal organisa-
tion entirely disappeared and its place was taken by a municipal
organisation, the different townships having a considerable stretch of
neighbouring territory assigned to them. Latin became here the
universally spoken=language5 Roman law everywhere prevailed. The
native civilisation entirely disappeared; Roman civilisation took its
place But, though the Latinising of the southern province was thus
complete, Gaul took no part in Latin literature comparable to that
taken by Spain. It produced, indeed, some orators of note and its
schools of rhetoric were famous, but rt contributed no single writer of
genius to Latin literature

The three other provinces were far less completely latinised. With
the exception of Lugdunum (Lyons), no Roman or Latin colonies were
originally established among them. The country was organised ona
tribul or cantonal, not on a municipal, basis The country districts did
not belong to the town, but the town was the capital of the canton or
tribe, frequently taking rts name from the tribe of which it was the
capital It was the tribe or canton, not the town, which sent
representatives to the natioual diet which the Romans caused to
assemble at Lyons, and it· was the canton and not the town which
furnished the area for local govemnrent, which assessed and raised its
own contribution to imperial expenditure, and had the right within
certain limits of managing its own local affairs. In these provinces
justice was also administered in accordance with local custom rather
than Roman law. Again, though proceedings before the magistrates
had to be conducted in Latin, the Roman officials not caring to
acquire the Celtic language, the native lauguage was employed in the
ordinary concems of everyday life; in some parts it continued to be
predominant, and everywhere traces of it long remained. The native
religion, too, the religion of the Druids, which under Roman influentes
almost disappeared from the South, continued ιο retain its hold on the
northern districts and remained throughout a force actively opposed to
Rome. The ranlrs of the Druid priesthood were largely recruited from
Britain, and it is probable that the conquest of Britain under Claudius
was undertaken in order to nreet the Druidical opposition in its remote
and chosen home Economically, too, the condition of the people
remained to a great extent unchanged as before the Roman conquest.
Just as in Caesar's time the great nobles had a large population
dependent on thern, standing towards them in a relation of slavery or
aemi-slavery, the result often of debt, so was it in Tacitus's time still
among the Treveri (iv 69, 70). Nor were the occupations of the North
aud South less distinct While ιιι the southern province the Romans
bad largely introduced the culture of the vine, which also to some
extent prevailed ιιι Aquitania, agriculture was the principal industry of
the denual and eastern provinces, the tending of flocks and herds the

In the division of functions it was agreed that while Vespasian himself
repaired to Alexandria, there to seize the corn-supply of Rome and if
necessary starve the capital into submission, to Mucianus should be
entrusted the taslr of leading the advance into Italy (it 81). He at
once set himself to raiae troops, to find money, to negotiata with the
neighbouring nations for the safety of the frontiersl The ileet was soon

moved from the Euxine to meet him at Byzantium, and he himself

’ 26 THE HISTORIES OF TACITUS staca.

reduced to real subiectiora Throughout this district the Spanish
cantonal unions were, except in name, dissolved and a number of
towns received instead the rights os Roman colonica chief among
these were the thriving commercial towns of the scacoast, Tarraco
itsell, Dertosa at the mouth of the Ebro, Barcino, north os that river,
and Valentia and Ilici tarther south; in the interior Caesaraugusta
(Saragossa) in the Ebro valley was the only town which received this
distinctiora From these centres Roman customs and¹ the Roman
language spread gradually throughout the province 3 and though. the
province of Hispania Citerior did not becom as completely Roman-
ised as the more southern districts, the native language had by this
time almost disappeared except among the mountains and among the
tribes oi the North and North-west.

(α) Baetica or Hispania Ulterior, originally kept by Augustus in
his own hands, was by him speedily given back to the Senate It
counted as a senatorial province of the second classone govemed,
that is, by an ex-praetor rather than a consular. Its capital was Corduba,
situated on the river Baetis It was a peaceful and prosperous region,
one of the inermes prostiterit ot which Tacitus speaks. Only quitea
small soree was stationed in it at Italica near Hispalis (Sewille),
intended to keep off the pirates who, swarming from North Africa,

Romanised. ⁸ In its southern district a number ol lull Roman colonias
and Latin colonies had been already established by Augustus To
the first class belonged Hispalis and Corduba 3 to the second Italica,
Gades, and Carteia Their numbers were increased and their population
was added to by Otho (i. 78). Before 69 ao. this province bad already
contributed some important names to Latin literature—Porcius Latro,
the master of Ovid and a poet of some eminence; Annaeus Seneca,
father ol the philosopher3 and Lucan the poet, grandson os Annaeus, all
came srom Corduba. From this district, too, came Pomponius Mela, a
‘native ol Tingentera, and Columella ol Gades, the first renowned for
his work on geograpby, the second tor his work on agriculture.

But the two most distinguished names which Spain gave to Latin
literature,- Martial from Bilbilis, Quinctilian from Calagurris on the
Ebro, though they were both living in 69 am, belong to a later date,
the age os Domitian. Yet by this time not only had the Latin language
become the prevailing language of the country, but Roman law and the
Roman religion were universally adopted, and the Roman municipal
system had taken the place os the earlier cantonal organisation.

(3) Lusitania corresponded to what is now Portugal, together with

Augusta (Merida) on the Anas, and it counted as a Caesarian provinc'e oi

when appointed governor. This district seems to have lagged behind
the other two provinces in prosperity and cultivation, and was accounted

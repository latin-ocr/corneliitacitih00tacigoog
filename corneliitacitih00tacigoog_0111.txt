of Central Germany. The camp itself lay partly on the slope of a
hill, partly on the plain, and was very insufficiently defended by
fortifications, since it had scarcely entered me minds of the ¹Romans
who built it that the headquarters of ,the legions could be them·
selves attached The Bataviam and Germans, however, comparatively
unslrilled in siege operations, were repelled on their first onset by the
steadiness, bravery, and resource of the beleaguered troops, they
then detennined to convert the assault into a blockade Horde
onius, informed of what was going on and' of the danger in ,which
the camp was placed, determined to hasten to its relief. The com-
mand of the forces he handed over to Vocula, an accomplished
officer, legate of the rst legion Relieved of the command, Horde-
onius, incapacitated by gout, floated more at his ease on a raft down
the stream. On his way he sent missives to the various states of Gaul
calling on them for assistance. Arrived at Bonn, the soldiers who
from the first had viewed him with suspicion broke out into more
open mutiny. The troops there attributed to his negligence and half·
heartedness the reverse they had recently suffered at the hands of the
Batavians, while all alike held him responsible for the dimensions
which the insurrection had now assumed To quiet them, Hordeonius
not only read to thern the despatches which had been just sent off to
the different Gallie states, but directed that for the future all despatches
should be read to the soldiers before being communicated to the
commandiug officere, a measure clearly subversive of all promptitude
and of all discipline Even these concessions failed to satisfy them,
and Hordeonius feeling himself powerless agreed to hand over the
direction of affairs to his subordinate Vocula. Vocula at once gave
orders for an immediate advance. On his way he was joined by
Herennius Gallus, who had commanded with such signal illsuccess in
the engagement before Bonn The two advanced together first to
Novesium (the modern Neuss) and then to, Gelduba, situated about
half-way between the last-named place and Vetera Here Vocula
turned aside to ravage the country of the Cugerni, a Gallie tribe in the
immediate neighbourhood who had lately thrown in their lot with
Civilis. In his absence the troops at Gelduba seized on Herennius,
- whom they chose to consider responsible for a defeat they suffered in
askirmish with the Germans, imprisoned him, and only released him
when Vocula himself at last reappeared on the scene It was the
divergence of sentiment between soldiers and leaders, and the mutual
distrust which this divergence produced, that constituted the real
danger of the Roman situation; neither officers nor men were sure
that the other party might not be in traitorous correspondence with
the enemy; such suspicions rendered the officers helpless, and made
possible in the soldiers insubordination and excesses such as we find
no parallel to elsewhere

Civilis meanwhile had continued to press on the siege, encouraging

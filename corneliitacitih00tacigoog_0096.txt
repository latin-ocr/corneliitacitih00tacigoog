crossed the river, clamomed to be led against them. Spurinna, unable
to resist their importunities, was forced to put himself at their head
and to quit his base at Placentia, though whether he advanced on the
north or the south side of the Po is not from Tacitus’s account quite
clear, probably on the latter. As evening drew near and his soldiers
found themselves out of sight of the river, and under the necessity of
fortifying a camp lest they should be surprised by the enemy, their
courage failed them, and they allowed themselves to be led baclr by
Spurinna within the shelter of their fortifications A short time after
this Caecina with his main army actually crossed the Po, apparently
at the point where his vanguard had already effected a passage, and
proceeded at ¹once to lay siege to Placentia He and his troops had,
however, under-rated the eourage of the praetorians, at least when
fighting‘behind walls The attaclr on the first day was rudely repelled ;
and though the Germans spent the next night in making more
elaborate preparations for the assault, it fared scarcely better with them
on the second day than it had on the first 3 and Caecina at the close
· of it was under the necessity of raising the siege, recrossing the Po,
and retiring once more on Cremona, which had been already occupied
by him Annius Gallus, who at the head of the rst legion (Adiutrix)
was on his way to relieve Placentia, hearing, while still on his march, of
Caecina's retreat and the direction which that retreat had taken, himself
also crosses the Po and takes up a position at Bedriacum, east of
Cremona, on the Postumian road between it and Mantua At Bedria-
cum, Annius Gallus seems to have been joined by the two other
commendem-in-chief, Marius Celsus and Suetonius Paulinus, though
at the head of what forces Tacitus has unfortunately omitted to state.
It would seem, however, that detachments at any rate of the Pannonian
and Dalmatian legions must already have come up3 in addition there
· were some of the cohorts of praetoriana, and a considerable force of
cavalry. Gallus atthis point became incapacitated by a fall from his
horseand Marius Celsus and Paulinus divided between them the supreme
command, the latter taking the infantry, the fonner the cavalry. At the
same time Marcius Macer succeeded in throwing a body of gladiators'
Α across the Po nearer to Cremona, and dislodging a piclret of the enemy.

The first engagement was brought on by the anxiety of Caecina to
recover his lost laurels. Repulsed at Placentia and worsted besides in
several encounters of no great importance, he thought that his prestige
would vanish, and that he would be entirely eclipsed by Valens in the
eyes of the army, unless he could do something before the arrival of the
latter to regain his repute as a commander. Himself entrenched before
Cremona, he threw forward a part of his auxiliary cavalry to a place
called ‘.‘ ad Castoris,'’ some wooded ground lying twelve miles from Cre-
mona on the road to Bedriacum and Mantua Here he hoped that his
cavalry might be concealed, and that the enemy advancing incautiously
might fall into the ambuscade which he bad thus laid for them The

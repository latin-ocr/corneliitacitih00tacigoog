says (ii. 82, 83), “the two opposing forces met in regular battle in the
Campus Martius3 fortune and the many victories they had already won
favoured the Flavians, the Vitellians had despair alone to animate them ;
though beaten they gathered once again within the city. As they
fought the people loitered around as spectators and, like as at some
gladiatorial contest, eheered on with shouts 3ηά applause this side' or
that Whenever one side gave way, il the vanquished hid themselves

in the shops or sought a reluge in any private house, the onloolrers de ,

manded that they should be dragged forth and slain, and then possessed
themselves ol the greater part ol the booty, ior while the soldiery were
talren up with bloodshed and slaughter, the spoils lell to the rabble.
The whole city presented a dreadful and ghastly sight: here were
fighting and wounds, there baths and cookshops ; there were to be
seen together gore and heaps ol slain, harlots and men worse than
harlots ; there all the lusts that luxurious ease could prompt, side by
side with all the crimes which accompany the sack ol a captured town.
The city seemed at once to have gone mad with lust of blood and to
be keeping a wauton festival Armed forces had encountered one
another before now in the streets ol Rome, twice when Sulla was the
conqueror, once when Cinna was so. On those occasions there vas no
less cruelty displayed3 now the awlul thing was the inhuman callousness
and the refusal by the crowd to intermit their pleasures even lor an
instant It wasa time ol festival, and as il lor that reason they were
bound to enjoy themselves the more, they broke out into a delirious
transport ol delight without a thought even lor the late ol their party,
actually revelling in the missortunes of their country.'’ That surely is
an indictment which could only have been written by one in whom the
actual sight ol the laets he describes had exhited the livehgst feelings
ol detestation and ol horror.

There is not much in the Fourth Book which we can ascribe to the
personal recollections ol Tacitus himself. The first chapter with its
powerlul description ol the terrorism which prevailed in the early days
ol Vespasian's reign is, perhaps, an exception. It may be that Tacitus had .
also himself visited Vetera and Augusta Treverorum. The account ol

both these localities is lar more minute and exact than is usual with him .

when descrihing places with which he was not personally acquainted.-
lt is at least a probable suggestion that his official duties during the
years when he was absent from Rome took him to this part os the
world One more picture Tacitus probably drew from memory—the
record ol the proceedings connected with the commencement ol the
rebuilding ol the famous temple ol Jupiter Capitolinus. The author
may have been among that great crowd ol people who helped to drag
with joyand enthusiasm the immense foundation-stone into its place
(iv. 53). All the details 333 here given with such precision as to make
the conjecture all but certain.

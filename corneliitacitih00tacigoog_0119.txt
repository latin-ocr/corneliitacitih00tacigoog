been preserved and the frontier adequately defended, but the country
had grown greatly in material wealth and prosperity 3 and tbe politica}
career for its citizens which the wide extension of the Roman franchise
within its limits bad opened up, was now by the more ambitious
among the nobles greatly appreciated. Gaul was rapidly learning to
identify itself with Rome, and to claim the glories of its mistress as its
own.

Thirdly‚ in two points, in consequence apparently of this revolt, the
Romans remodelled their military system. Hitherto the Batavians and
other corps of auxiliary troops had been allowed to be officered by
their own native princes. Civilis and his brother were at the head of
twoBatavian corps; Classicus commanded a troop of Treveran horse,
Tutor was responsible for the defence of the Rhine in the immediate
neighbourhood of bis own country. For the future this course was no
longer followed. The officers of the auxiliary forces were selected not
from their own countrymen, but from the stoclr from which Vespasian
himself arose, from the small farmers and inhabitants of the country
towns of Italy. Many rising ambitione were thus nipped in the bud
and Rome was saved from the necessity of a number of little vars.
Secondly the German auxiliary forces were chiefly brigaded along with
the troops serving in their own country. Henceforth this was to be
no longer allowed. From Vespasian’s time onwards the names of
German cohorts are found scattered over tbe length and breadth of the
empire Asinius plan had been already adopted in respect of the
Pannonian cohorts after the great rising in Pannonia in the later part

of Augustus’s reign ln both cases the adoption of the plan seems to
, have been a complete success Alter Civilis’s rising - the German
frontier settled down again into complete peace, and the disturbance,
when disturbance there was, came only from the independent tribes
settled east of the Rhine. .

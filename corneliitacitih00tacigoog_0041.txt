22 THE HISTORIES OF TA CITUS sacr. l

η of the Annals. Such were—(1) the octa senatus, acta patrum, or
commentarii senatus. η The dry particulam of debates in the Senate
which occur in Book 1v come most likely from this source. (a) The
octa populi, called also simply acta, oracta publia, acta diuma urbis,
diuma actomm sm'ptura, and diurna Populi Romani. This was a sort
of gazette or newspaper, pubhshed, as its name implies, daily‚ in which
was recorded whatever was supposed to be of most public interest
It would seem as if Tacitus used these two sources less in the Hr'ston'es
than in the Annals‚ partly because he could here more rely on the
fuller details of personal recollection, partly because in the confusion
of the year'69 it may well have been that they were publisbed with
lesscarethan in more tranquil times (3) The commentarii prtitct'pum, the
private joumals of the princeps, handed down to his successors. Tacitus
notices (iv. 40) that a demand was made on the accession of Vespasian
that the curamentarti'of his predecessors should be submitted to the
Senate in order that it might be known who had played the part of
informem The demand, however, was deferred, and ultimately appar·
ently not complied with In any case these would fumish material for
history only just so far as the prtirceps chose to make them known.
(4) Edr’cta in populum. These were public property and so could be
consulted. Tacitus refers (ii. 62) to an edict of Vitellius, (iii. 7 3) to
certain edicta (manifestoesl of the consul Quinctius Atticus, and (iv. 49)
toan edict of Piso, proconsul of Africa There were also senatus con·
sulfa and tabulae publr'cae which our author could consult

ἓ 4 It remains finally to investigate the different sources frorn which
Tacitus derived bis strange account of the origin and early history of the
Jewish tace. That he was unacquainted both with the Old Testament
and with the work of Josephus is obvious on the face of his narrative
itself His ignorance of the Old Testament is sufficiently explained
by the difficulties which the Septuagint translation would necessarily
present to a foreigner, perhaps also by the contempt felt by a cultivated
Roman for the sacred literature ofa despised and detested racc Jose
phus's Antiquitics appeared so little before the Historias that it is not
surprising if they had not had time to find their way into the hands of
our author. Tacitus's account of the origin of the Jewish tace seems
to be based on a collection of myths, not always consistent with one
another, themselves originating in some fanciful derivation of the names
Judaei and Hierosolyma The supposed connection of the Jews with
Saturn no doubt rests mainly on their known reverence for the Sabbatb‚
which among the Romans was regarded as Satum's day. Justin has
been found to be an authority for the story which connects them with
Damascus and Assyria. In his account of their expulsion from Egypt
under King Bocchoris, Tacitus follows Lysimachus, a Greek writer of
the second century before Christ, while his account of Moses and the
wanderings of the Israelites in the wildemess seems to be derived from
the writings of Manetho, the Egyptian priest, who wrote in the reign of

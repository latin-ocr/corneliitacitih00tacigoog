torians, which originated with the cohort stationed at Ostia, throwsa
fiood of light on the suspicions with which the soldiers regarded the
relation of the senators to the emperor of their choice. Otho seems to
bave acted well on the occasion, doing what he could, alilre to allay the
panic of the senators and the unreasoning fury of the soldiery, and the
speech which Tacitus puts into his mouth was one which no com.
mandet need have been ashamed to make. He aclrnowledges the
personal loyalty of the praetorians to himself, and warns them that
they must not allow it to carry theru to lengths, which would eudanger
their cause and his, by arraying the gratu name of the Senate in opposi-
tion to it That, moreover, he did not consider the suspicions of the
troops as to the disloyalty of the senators towards br‘mself wholly ground·
less, may be gathered from the care which he takes to carry the main
bulk of the Senate with him when be sets out for the seat of swar.
That he should have insisted on doing this Tacitus professes to con·
sidera harah measure3 yet it was under all the circumstances scarcely
more tharra measure of ordinary precautiou. Taking a review, then,
of all these facts we shall, 1 tbinlr, conclude that while Otho’s
antecedents had no doubt been bad, and there was much in his
earlier career to excuse and to justify alarm, arrd admitting also that he
had gained bis throne by means not creditable to him, means which to
a large extent placed him at the mercy of the praetoriana to whom he -
was indebted for it, yet his actual conduct on the throne was not such
asto deserve the censure which Tacitus heaps upon it, and that the
historiar, in the view be has taken of that conduct, represents not the
werdict of impartis] history but that oi a elique influenced alilre by
fear and by dislilre

And asin Book 1. Tacitus has exaggerated the blame which
can fairly be laid at Otho's door, so in Boolr 11 he has minimised
the difficulties thrown in his way by the lukewarmness and bad saith of
the senatorial leaders who accompanied him to the war, No doubt
the campaign was greatly mismanaged3 it seems almost a pity
that, if he was not himself goin'g to take a more active part in the
duection of the war and the control of affairs, be ever- quitted Rome,
though perhaps the soldiers would hardly have been induced to leave
the city without him 3 his electiori to remain at Brixellum while the issue
was being fought out at Bedriacum was, as Tacitus remarks, fatal to
the spirit and male of his troops3 his determination to light at once
instead of waiting for the arrival of the Pannonian and Moesian legions,
in the teeth too of the advice of Paulinus, the ablest of his generals,
seems little short of madness. But the troops, at any rate, were
profoundly convinced that there was treachery fromthe very first on
the part of the generals. Paulinus’s refusal to follow up his advantage
alter th‘e battle of ad Castoris was universally condemned and looks very
like an act of bad faith3 'the necessity which Otho found himself
under of superseding his original generals by his brother Titianus, 'just

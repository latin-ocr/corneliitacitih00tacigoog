Four small provinces encircled Italy on the west and north-the
Alpes Maritimae, Raetia, Vindelicia, Noricum. They were all finally
subdued by Augustus, and all owed their organisation to him3 all
exhibit the same general characteristica They were all minor pro
vinces, govemed by procuratore directly appointed by the emperor.
Each of them was garrisoned not by Roman troops but by cohorts and
alae of the allies, supported by a native militia Augustus's objectio
thus organising them was to keep the great military commands at a
distance from Italy and to encircle that country by a cordon of minor
states from which no immediate danger would have to be apprehended,
but which yet should be sufficiently near to the great armies of the
frontier to malea revolt dangerous and unlikely. Thus Raetia was
kept ιιι check by the camp at Vindonissa, Vindelicia and Noricum by
the standing camps in Pannonia.

The Alpes Maritimae was constituted a province by Augustus' ιιι 14
ne, at which time he was engaged ιιι organising the whole Alpine
froritier of Italy. It was governed by a procurator, and was protected
by forces of the allies raised among its native Ligurian population. It
covered the greater part of what is now called the Westem Riviera, but
also followed the line of the Alps inland for aconsiderable distance.
Tacitus, who probably knew it personally since his father-in-law had a
house in the district, speaks of it as a prosperous country-the fields full
of crops, the houses standing open (ιι. ra). The thriving town of Albinti-
milium, the capital, was sacked by the Othonians at the beginning of the
campaign against Vitellius In the sack the mother of Agricola lost
her life, and much of Agricola's patrimony was plundered (Ag. 7). .
Tne mid, however, into this defenceless district did not influence the
main issue of the war, nor was the Othonian fleet able even to effect
a serious diversion by threatening the coasts of the Narbonensis. The
Vitellians were then too strong in Gaul, Otho's fleet too weak ιιι troops
for the Vitellians to feel the line of their advance even threatened.
Fora moment later on the district once more appears on the scene.
Fabius Valens, flying before the forces of Vespasian, sought and found
with Marius Maturus, procurator of the Alpes Maritimae, a safe though
a temporary shelter. On his venturing, however, to attempt a landing·
on the coast of Gallia Narbonensis he was captured at the Stoechades
Insulae by Valerius Paulinus, procurator at Forum Julii‚ and carried off
in triumph to the Flavian leaders (iii. 42, 43).

Three small districts of nominally independent tribes, known by
the names of the Alpes Graiae, Cottiae, and Penninae, separate the Alpes
Maritimae from the neighbouring province of Raetia. This, though
lar more important than the tiny districtos the Alpes Maritimae, yet
resembled ιι ιιι its main features-that rs to say, it was an imperial

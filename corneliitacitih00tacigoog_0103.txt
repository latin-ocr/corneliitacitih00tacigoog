84 THE HISTORIES OF TACITUS secr.

Meanwhile Caecina had fortified his camp in the neighbourhood of
Hostilia just north of the Po, having his rear covered by that river, his
llanks protected by the marshes of the Tartarus, a branch of the Athesis
or Adige. His forces, consisting of the4th, the 5th, the 15th, 16th,
and aad legions, together with drafts of the three legions of Britain,
were so superior in number to the enemy that it was believed, and
believed with good reason, that had he advanced· against Antonius at
once he might either have annihilated his army or driven it in
headlong flight from Italy. As it was, the thought of treachery stayed
his haud and gave the enemy time to concentrate. While he was still
hesitating the yth (Claudiana) carne up from Moesia, but Caecina still
preferred to parley, not to fight The delay allowed the two other
Moesian legions, the 3d and the 8th, to join Antonius, who then felt
himself sufficiently strong to venture to put Verona in a state of
defence While engaged in this work Antonius’s own troops broke
out into open mutiny against their nominal commandere The yth
(Galbiana) all but murdered Tampius Flavianus, the governor of
Pannonia, from whose province they came 3 while Aponius Saturninus,
the legate of Moesia, was only just rescued from the fury of the
Moesian legions Antonius succeeded in quelling both disturbances,
but Roman opinion credited him with having secretly fermented them
asa means of ridding himself of his legal superiors who might prove
themselves hereafter inconvenient rivals As a matter of fact both
legates sought safety in retirement and relieved Antonius and the army
of their presence (iii. 9).

Meanwhile at Ravenna the lieet, with Lucilius Bassus the admiral
at its head, declares for Vespasian. Bassus had already concerted
mensures with Caecina3 and the lieet, mannedmainly by Dalmatians
and Pannoniam, was more than ready to espouse a cause which their
brothers in the legions had already adopted. Caecina as soon as he
heard of the treachery of the lieet declared himself willing to follow the
example set by the sailorsy but the soldiers, less pliant than their
general, refusa, after the first surprise, to go over with him. They cast
him into chains and selected as their leaders Fabius Fabullus, legate
of the 5th legion, and Cassius Longinus, praefect of the camp. They
then, after breaking the bridge, retire from Hostilia in the direction of
Cremona purposing to juin the rst and arst legions, whom Caecina
had sent on in advance to that place in order to garrison it.

Antonius, as soon as he was infonned of this move, determined at
once to set out in pursuit; he was anxious to engage the enemy before the
authority of the newlychosen leaders was established or reinforcements
from the north could reach them by way of Raetia. Advancing from
Verona in two days he reached Bedriacum, and came to a halt there.
The next day he employed part of his forces in fortifying a camp, while
with the cavalry and light-armed troops he advanced to plunder the
territory of Cremona He himself at the head of four thousand cavalry

[libra—For those parts of this chapter, which are not derived
directly from Tacitus, the author is mainly indehted to Professor
Mommsen’s volumes on the Provinces of the Roman Empire]

In the events of '⁶9 ab. the Provinces played an important, in
some respects the leading, part It was the rising of Vindex in Gaul
which hurled Nero from the throne and erentually placed Galba on it·
Otho owed his elevation not a little to the jealousy felt by the city
soldiery against the provincial armies by which Galba was supported¹
The rising of the German troops directed at first against the predomin-
ance of Spaniards and Gauls turned after the¹ downfall of Galba intoa
struggle of the greatest and most famous of the provincial armies
against tlie forces of the capital. But the divulging of the secret “that
an emperor could be made elsewhere than at' Rome ’' had already
brought fresh competitors into thesseld. The Pannonian legions,
together with those of Dalmatia and Moesia, had been anxious to try at
once their prowess on the fields of North Italy against the soldiers of
Germany, and it was only Otho's impatience and precipitaney which
had prevented more than a small fraction of them from doing so. The
chance which Otho had denied thern they obtained under Antonius
Primus and Arrius Varus. Helped by Caecina's treachery and the
leaderless condition of the German troops they proved themselves in
the second battle of Bedriacum more than a match for their antagonists
The work which they had begu'n was completed hythe Syrian troops
The struggle in and around Rome which followed may be regarded as
one of the oft-repeated struggles between East and West; but the
incapacity of Vitellius, the superior numbers, the superior generalship,
perhaps also the presence in their midst of the recently disbanded ,
praetorian guards, gave almost for the first time in history the victory
to the forces of the East In the West later on it loolred for a moment
almost as if the Gauls under Civilis, abetted by the Germans across the
Rhine, might succeed in shaking off the yolre of Rome, and establish-
ing for themselves an empire of their own across the Alps. But the
majority of the Gauls preferred at heart to keep the Romans rather
,than to take the Germana for their masters 3 and as soon as Rome
had decided who should be the ruler she chose herself to obey,
Vespasian had no difficulty in restoring his authority over the revolted
districts 3 and “the Empire of the Gauls” collapsed before the first
vigorous measure taken against it, almost without a struggle.

Spain, the earliest of Rome’s distant possessione but almost the last ·
to be finally conquered, was organised by Augustus himself in the years

down the stream of the Arar. At Lyons he first established the
parade of a court, being enabled to do so by the munificence of Julius
Blaesus, ruler of the Lugdunensis, who fumished him with the means.
At Lyons too be was met by Valens and Caecina and the other chiefs
of the victorious army, and here in their presence he consented on bis
little son the name of Germanicus, a sign of the source from which he
drew his power. Gaul had no better cause to love the soldiers of'
Vitellius than she had previously had for loving those of Valens and
Caecina Rapine and insult remained still the order of the day. The
rising of Mariccus which toolr place at this time is an index of the
state of popular feeling in the Gallie provinces. Mariccus, a humble
member of the bumble tribe of the Boii, themselves dependants of the
more powerful Haedui, gave himself out as a god and the saviour of his
country. His call to anns was obeyed by his own countrymen and by
some of the villages of the Haedui, but the nobles held aloof, and
assisted by some cohorts which Vitellius placed at their disposal easily
dispersed the fanatical rabble‚ as Tacitus describes them Mariccus
paid the penalty for his patriotism by the death ofa slave When
Vitellius arrived in Italy he thought it more prudent as wellas more
economical to dismiss to their own homes the majority of the Gallie
auxiliarios who had flocked to the standards of Valens during his
march through the country. The sudden disbanding of so large a
body of troops must have added to the elements of disturbance already
existing in the country, and helped materially to pave the way for that
widespread rising of the Gauls in which the revolt of Civilis culminated.
Tbe hostility which the march of Vitellius and his armies had excited
in the country is shown later on by the reception accorded to Valens
whenasafugitive he attempted to land on the coast of Gallia Narbonensis.
Valerius Paulinus, procurator of the province, stationed at Colonia
Foroiuliensis, had, directly the advance of the Flavians into Italy had
been heard of, at once bound over the inhabitants of that part of the
world to allegiance to Vespasian. When Valens attempted to land, ’
Paulinus guthered hastily together some of the troops recently dis·
banded by Vitellius, as well as some civilians. By them Valens was
forced to return to his ships, and driven shortly afterwards by adverse
vinds to the Stoechades Islands, near Marseilles, was there captured
by order of Paulinus. On receipt of tbis news the Gauls lost no time
in throwing in their lot with the fortunes of Vespasian. The subsequent
history of Gaul in this year will be traced when we come to deal with
the outbreak of Civilis

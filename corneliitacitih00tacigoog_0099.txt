80 THE HISTORIES OF TACITUS sacr.

in consequence. Otho thought it necessary to supersede him, and
appointed to his command Flavius Sabinus, the consul designate.
The mutinous conduct ol the troops did much to damp the ardour of
the Othonian generals, and made them more inclined to the treachery
which many of them'were already meditating.

As soon as an advance was determined on, the Othonian leaders
at once quitted Bedriacum and pitched their camp four miles west ol
it on the road to Cremona. From this point onwards the details ol
the operations as recorded by Tacitus are so difficult ol credit that
Mommsen considers the historian has altogether misconceived the
scope and object of the different manoeuvres which he describes.
Tacitus says that Otho’s army set out from their camp with the inten-
tion ol making good their way to the junction ol the Adda and the Po,
four or five miles to the west ol Cremona and ol the enemy’s position
outside its walls. As such a movement would have exposed thern, as
it actually did, to all the dangers oi a ssank attack from an enemy who
were themselves strongly entrenched, Mommsen holds that the Othonian
leaders could not have been guilty ol such solly, but must have intended
in the first place to establish themselves on the road from Brescia to
Cremona so as to intercept reinsorcements coming from the north,
though ultimately they may have desired to outflank the enemy's posi-
tion by occupying aspoint beyond it. It must be remembered, how-
ever, that it might well have seemed to the Othonianleaders that, should
the enemy succeed in constructing their bridge on which they were
engaged, the whole right bank ol the Po would then be at their command,
and that to secure a position beyond, ie. to the west ol them, would be
necessary, were anything effectual' to be done in the way os stopping
their march on Rome, as the route over the Maritime Alps and through
Etruria would then be open to them. However this may be, there
seems no reason to doubt that the Othonians did advance too close to
the enemy's position and did expose themselves to the dangers of that
flank attack which rightly seemed to Tacitus so very sormidable. That
they did this in the teeth os the advice of their best generals is likely
enough3 that they actually did it seems almost beyond question.
Whatever the motives which influenced them they set out, as Tacitus
says, equipped sor a war rather than a battle, with the expectation, it
would seem, that they were going to make a long stay in irunt ol
Cremona The Postumian road along which they marched, carried
on a raised causeway through the damp helds which then as now
sringed either bank ol the river, made them at once a better mark lor
the enemy and compelled them to advance on a narrow frunt. The
long distance too which the Othonians had to march, some sixteen
miles at least before reaching the enemy, was further sorely against
them. When they arrived within sight oi the enemy‘ they were
already exhausted, while these latter were able to remain at their
ease within their fortifications and prepare themselves at their leisure

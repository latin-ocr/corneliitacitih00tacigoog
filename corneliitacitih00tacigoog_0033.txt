14 THE HISTORIES OF TA CITUS secu.

strength gradually undermined by the enervating climate and the undis·
ciplined ill-regulated lives they lived (ii 93). He witnessed too, and
the sight moved him to no little indignation, the celebration a few days
later of Vitellius’s birthday and the funeral feast held in the Campus
Martius to Nero’s shade, and the revelling and the gladiatorial shows
in the streets with which the day was concluded (ii. 95). Scarcely less
vivid, though far less elaborate, is the account of the outward march
of Caecina's army, when at last the news of the fast-gathering storm
forced him to quit the city: the listless bodies, the drooping spirits of the
men, the slow and broken march, the arms dropping from their hands,
the tired homes, all these are recorded with the precision of one who
had seen and marked the contrast they presented to the brave appear·
ance of the victorious army only a few weeks previously (ii 99).

The next scenes which we can with confidente affirm that Tacitus

described from personal recollection are those of the closing days of
Vitellius's reign and life, his attempted abdication, the sturming and
buming of the'Capitol by the Vitellians, the entry of the Flavianist

troops into the city, and the sights of carnage and inhuman indifference
to it by which that entry was followed. The tale of Vitellius’s
attempted abdication·(iii. 68), “when a Roman emperor sought to
divest himself of his dignity while women even looked on,’' is told with
an indignant pathos which seems to bespeak the feelings of one who
had himself witnessed the shameful sight Nor is the account of the
storming and buming of the Capitol less minute and circumstantia}
(iii. 71). Each successive stage in the attack-the rapid advance of
the troops up the lower part of the hill, the breaking in of the door
at the foot of the steps, that portico on the right as you go up to the
Capitol on to the roof of which the “defenders mounted and from
which they discharged stones and tiles at the Vitellians,'’ the torches
which the latter replied with, and Sabinus's hurried barricading of the
passage with the statues which he had had torn down3 then the attack
from the other side, the rush of the besiegers into the Asylum, and
the fatal tiring of the temple of Capitoline Jove-all this is noted
and made clear 3 and indeed almost the whole scene must have been
visible from the Forum, where the citizens stood and looked on. All
the details relating to the destruction of so great and famous a shrine
as the temple of Capitoline Jove, the very palladium of the Empire,
must have branded themselves into the memory of every patriotic man
and youth. The young Tacitus was one on whom so remarkable a
scene was bound to make a profound impression.

Iu a later chapter Tacitus seems to give expression to the feeling
of personal horror with which one sight had filled him. He had been
describing the advance of the Flavians and the entry of Vespasian’s
army in three divisions into the city, the attempts which had been made
to secure peace, the many conflicts.generally to the advantage of the
attacking side which had been fought outside the walls. “At last,” he

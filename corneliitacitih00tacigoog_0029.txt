10 THE HISTORIES OF TA CITUS sacr.

being farther removed from his own time and requiring a greater eisort
of imagination to present it in its true colours, the Annals are less irn-
partial *and less trustworthy than are the Historias, more exaggerated
and more overcoloured. We shall hardly be wrong again in saying
that, as years grew upon him, a more severe and desponding tone·
became habitual with the historian. The hopes which the earlier years
ol Trajan’s reign had excited had died away within him. This growing
despondency both explains his selection oi the earlier reigns as the
subject to be treated, and also accounts for the more severe and un·
compromising judgment which he passed upon them. lt requires a
morecheerlul, hopelul creed than that of Tacitus to malrethe judg-
ments ol our old age more charitable than those oi our youth.

And yet when all has been said against the Anna& that can be said,
with what a splendid panorama oi a period do they and the Hr'ston'cs
together, even in the incomplete and fragmentary shape in which they
have come down to us, present usi ln their completeness they told
in thirty books the tale oi more than eighty years-from the acces-
sion of Tiberius to the death ol Domitian. Ol what similar period in
the world’s history has the record been given with equal brilliancy,
variety, soree, perspicuity? No doubt there are faults (faults greater
generally in the Annali than in the Historias) which modern critics
lind We should olten, it has been urged, have been glad to hear less
about the doings and intrigues oi the court and the gossip oi the city,
more about the misery or prosperity ol the sarmers and pessants ol
Italy, and ol the inhabitants ol the provinces. ln the accounts of
campaigns, too, we could well have dispensed with the speeches put
into the generals' mouths, and even the epigrama made upon their con-
duct, could we have had in their place more exact and fuller details oi
the operatione carried on by them, and the disposition of the forces they ,
commanded We should have been glad to have heard, also, more-of the
methods oi Roman govemment and its effect upon the subject peoples,
less ol personat detail respecting individual governors-their comings
and goings, the ups and downs they had encountered in the joumey ot
lite. Such are the demands we make3 such the blemishes in the
historian's narrative we vainly seek to have corrected But Tacitus
might reply that we go to history with other objecta than that with
which he wrote it; that while with us its interest is mainly antiquarian
and scientific, or at most political, this was not so with him. History
in his eyes wasa branch ol moral philosophy, perhaps not the least

important branch “I hold it to be the chief office of history,” he
wrote (Ama iii. 65), “to rescue virtue lrom oblivion, and that base
words and deeds should have the sear of po'sthumous iniamy.'’ History
shows us in conspicuous examples the misery which vices cause, and
the happy results ol a virtuous and well-regulated lile Though the
age which he describes is rich in horrors, “it is yet not so sterile in
virtues as not to fumish aswell good examples of high value ’' (H. i. 3).

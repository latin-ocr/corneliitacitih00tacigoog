tius Gallus, the Roman governor of Syria, had under these circum-
stances to be called in to stay the insurrection He succeeded in
capturing Joppa, when the whole body of citizens was put to death,
and in September appeared before Jerusalem itself But be could not
take the capital, was forced to raise the siege, and had even to purchase
a hasty retreat'by the sacrifice of his baggage and his rear-guard The
Roman government, at last alarrned, sent Titus Flavius Vespasianus to
undertake the command of the war. Vespasian had already seen con-
siderable service, he had served in Germany and Britain, and had
been proconsul of Africa He retained still many of the virtues of the
Sabine yeoman class, frorn which he sprang. He had not liked, and
had not pretended to like, Nero's singing. That emperor, perhaps be· .
cause he wanted a capable general, perhaps out of revenge, had chosen

him to conduct the difficolt and troublesome Jewish war. He was .
given three legions to carry it on-the roth Fretensis, wbich formed .

a part of the old army of Syria 3 the 5th Macedonica, which had been
brought up horn the West, from Moesia, in 63 no. to talre part in the
Parthian war then raging; and the 1 yth Apollinaris, summoned at the
same time from Pannonia. Besides these he had the usual force of .
auxiliary troops, and contingents fumished by four client kings-the kings
of Commagene, Emessa, Nabatea, and Agrippa, who was sovereign of a
part of Palestine His total force amounted to fifty thousand men in
all (M. P. R E ii aro, 211). In the spring of 67 aa. this army was
brought togeth'er at Ptolemais and advanced into Palestine: Vespasian
employed the whole of his first campaign in bringing intubis power the
fortresses of the small district of Galilee and of the coast as far as As·
calon, sorry-five days being spent in the reduction of the little town of
Jotapata alone During the winter of 6768 one legion lay at scyrus
polis on the southern borders of Galilee, the two others in Caesarea
In the second year, ia in the earlier part of 68 an, Vespasian
reduced the Transjordanic territory, particularly the two important
towns of Gadara and Gerasa, and then took up his position at Emmaus
and Jericho. Starting from this base he successively occupied Idumaea
on the south, and Samaria on the north, so that by the summer of 68 aa.
Jerusalem was surrounded on every side. The siege of the city itself
was just beginning when news reached him of Nero’s death and Galba's
proclamation as emperor, and Vespasian thereupon broke up the siege,
waiting for further orders. Before these orders arrived the good season
of the year had corne to an end, and* nothing more could be attempted
till the following spring. When the spring came Galba was already
overthrown, and Vespasian and his soldiers waited alilre to see what
would be the issue of the contest between Otho and Vitellius. The
soldiers indeed had a mind at once to proclaim their leader emperor,
but the policy of Mucianus and Vespasian prevailed against their eager-
ness, and delay was for the present resolved upon. When the battle
of Bedriacum settled the matter in Vitellius’s favour Vespasian for

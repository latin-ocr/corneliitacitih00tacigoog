at the same time the Germans from the other side ot the Rhine to
devastate the territories oi those of the Gallie tribes in this quarter
who still remaiued faithful to Rome He conducted in person a
marauding expedition into the territory ot the Ubii, a tribe regarded
by the Germane with special detestation because having been originally
Germans they had accepted the yolre and the civilisation oi Rome,
and had even allowed an altar ior the worship oi the emperor,
analogous to the one at Lyons, to be established in their midst
Retuming from this expedition, laden with its spoils, Civilis determined
to renew the attaclr upon the fortifications3 but though the battle
lasted ior two days and a night, the undisciplined valour ot the
Germane was once more ioiled by the superior skill and resource
oi the legionary troops, who fighting behind fortifications were able
to inflict crushing loss upon the enemy with little loss to themselves
After this second iailure the siege onoe again settled down into a
bloclrade ν

It was while matters were in this state that news reached the two
armies ol the second battle at Bedriacum and ol the total destruction '
ol Vitellius’s army. The soldiers in the Roman armies, urged thereto
by their tribunes and superior officers, grudgiugly took the oath of
allegiance to Vespasian, calling at the same time on Civilis to lay aside
arms which he had uo longer any excuse ior wielding against the armies
ol Rome. Civilis only replied by doing his best to corrupt the Gallie
ambassador, Montanus, who had been sent to carry him the news oi
the battle and the demands os the army3 nor was he altogether unsuc-
'cessiul in his attempta. He continued meanwhile to beleaguer the gar·
rison oi Vetera with the same vigour as previously, hoping now to bring
'the siege speedily to a favourable conclusion. On another side he
sent out the most trustworthy oi his forces to fall suddenly on Vocula
in his camp at Gelduba For a moment, owing mainly to the treachery
of the auxiliaries, the Roman legions were in serious danger, but the
timely arrival on the scene oi some Basque troops spread panic among
the Germane, saved the Roman troops, and converted what might
have been a crushing deleat into a considerable victory. Vocula,
however, sailed to improve his opportunity at once, and gave to the
enemy encamped around Vetera time to strengthen their position
against him When a day or two later he actually appeared, his men, as
soon as they came in sight oi the enemy, insisted on being at once led
to battle, and were so far superior as to force the Germans to raise the
siege. But Vocula a second time failed to iollow up his advantage, and
in place of pursuing the routed enemy contented himself with strengthen-
ing the fortifications oi Vetera and with laying in provisions, as ii he >
expected a renewal os the siege His dilatory movements and apparent
hesitation only confirmed his soldiers in the suspicions oi treachery
they already entertained In order to put the camp in a position
of security it was necessary that provisions should be brought up from

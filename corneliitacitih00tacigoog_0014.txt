PREFACE

THERE are, curiously enough, but few English editions of the
Historias os Tacitus. The translations ol this work are numerous,
and several of them excellent; but almost the only complete

Mr. Furneaux might ultimately be loolred for, l should not

the great obligations I am under to his careful and scholarly
edition 'of the earlier books of the Annalr, and the admiration
I entertain for it Since this work was in the Press there has
appeared the second part of a school edition ol the Hutories,
by Mr. Α D. Godley, based mainly on the German edition
of Heraeus, the notes of which are a model of terseness and
clearness

At the outset of my labours I had hoped to have had the
assistance in them of my friend and quondam colleague, the
Rev. W. F. Short, who would have brought to the task a taste
and scholarship to which l cannot lay claim; circumstances
have, however, rendered it impossible for him to give me his
assistance, and so 1 have had to labour on alone. In the notes

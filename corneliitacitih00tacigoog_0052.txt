beginning of ‚Å∂9 nu. In respect of loyalty the eastern cantons situated
in the neighbourhood of the greatRoman camps were more favourable
to the Roman cause than the western, where a spirit of opposition still
survived, aspirit fermented not a little hythe religious zeal of the
Druids. Aquitania also attained to a larger degree of Roman culture
than did the more remote and more warlilre Belgica

The movement which drove Nero fmm the imperial throne and
placed Galba upon it in his stead originated in Gaul Julius Vindex,
the author of it, boasted of being through his mother a descendant of
Julius Caesar. In the latter part of Nero's reign he was governor
apparently of the Caesarian province of Aquitania The heavy taxation
under which the country groaned led himin desperation to rise against
the Roman authority, and having invited the chiefs of the neighbouring
armies to join the insurrection, he summoned the nation to arms. The
call, however, was most imperfectly obeyed, and he found himself with
arr inferior force confronted by the legions of Germany with Verginius
Rufus at their head Verginius, it is stated, was willing to have treated
with him, but the soldiers under his command refused to hear of any
parley and attached with the utmost vigour'the forces which Vindex
had brought into the field These forces fell an easy prey to the
trained veteram of the German army, and the ease with which they
were conquered brought the Gauls generally into contempt Vindex,
seeing his army dispersed, in desperation slew himself. The victors
thereupon offered the crown to their own commander, but Verginius
had either the prudence or the patriotism to. refuse the offered prize,
though only, it would seem, after some hesitation. Meanwhile Galba
in Spain was persuaded or forced into accepting the position which
Verginius had left vacant, and was accepted by the Senate and the .
people as the bert choice open to them under the circumstances

Galba, when he ascended the throne, proved himself not unmindful
of those to whom in the first instance his success might seem to have
been due He granted the boon of Roman citizenship to those
cantans and individuals who had shown themselves most energetic
in support of the muse of Vindex, and further remitted to them a
fourth part of their tribute These concessions served only to embitter
still more the feelings of the German armies and of those tribes of the
North-East who had generally sided with them (i 53). The fact that in
some instances Galba deprived these latter of part of their territory to
enrich with it the partisans of Vindex added further fuel to the flame.
The soldiers now began to talk of Gaul as a conquered country, and to
reckon up the wealth they would acquire by its plunder and devasta-
tiou Tne sunny southern lands into which they had strayed to meet
the forces of Vindex seemed to them infinitely preferable to the cold
and cheerleas districts in which hitherto their lot had been cast They
grew reatless and discontented, dreaming of golden harvests which
awaited them, aud of the enjoyment of ease and comfort to which they

46 THE HISTORIES OF TACITUS μ sacr.

the standing camps oi the legions, were centres from which Roman
influences were gradually spreading.

In the events ol this year Dalmatia does not play as leading a part
as Pannonia or even as Moesia Its governor was Pompeius Silvanus,
an old and unenterprising man (ii 86). He had under him two
legions, the rrtb (Claudia) and ·the famous r4tb, the latter having
been sent there apparently aller Nero’s death (ii rr). These, perhaps
hailing Otho.as Nero’s successor, bad promptly declared themselves ·
lor him (i. 76), and detacbments oi them two thousand strong were sent
on to j0in Otho at Brixellum and actually toolr part in the battle ol
Bedriacum Alter this battle the r4th did not retum to Dalmatia
but was by Vitellius sent back into Britain, so that there would seem
to have been only a single legion in the country when Vespasian's
emissaries came to raise the district This, the rrth‚ following the
lead ol the Pannonian and Moesian legions, rallied to the standard ol
Antonius, and seems to have been not a little instmmental in winning
over to the same cause the fleet stationed at Ravenna, which was
largely manned by native Dalmatians The desertion ol the lieet from
Vitellius was one ol the tumiug points iu the war. A little later we
lind six thousand native Dalmatians accompanying the rrth legion ou its
advance into Italy (iii. 50), and filling up the vacancies which occurred
in Vespasian's lieet in consequence ol many ol the sailors being dralled
off into the legions. At a still later date the rrth, which seems
not meanwhile to have returned to Dalmatia, accompanied Cerialis to
meet Civilis iu Gaul (iv. 68).

(a) Pannonia was a large district bounded on the west by
Noricum, on the north and east by the Danube, and extending so far
south as to include the valleys ol the Drave and Save. Indeed the
province was gradually extended northward lrom these southern valleys.
The headquarters ol the troops were originally at Siscia and Sirmium
in the valley ol the Save3 then they were moved to Poetovio (Pettau)
on the confines ol Noricum in the valley ol the Drave (this the head·
quarters ol the 13th legion seems to have been the military capital
ol the district at this time, H. iii 1); finally under Vespasian they
were planted at Carnuntum (Petronel) and Vindobona (Vienna) ou
the Danube itsell. The district was peopled by a portion of the
same Albaniam stock who inhabited Dalmatia, and offered in the first
instance little opposition to the advance ol the Roman anns It joined
indeed in the great insurrection oi 6·9 ab, but when subdued in the
latter year did not again renew the struggle It gradually adopted
Roman customs and the Latin language -from the legions stationed in
its midst Pannonia formed in the times ol the Empire one ol the
< great military and so one ol the great political centres ol the Roman
world. “ln the army ol the Danube the Pannonian corps held the
leading position, like the Rhenish in the West3 and the Dalmatian
and Moesian forces attached themselves to them and were subordinate

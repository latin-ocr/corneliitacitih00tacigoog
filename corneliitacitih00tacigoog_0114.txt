together in Cologne and debated what course under the circumstances
they should advise their countrymen to adopt Tbey agreed that the
fateful honr had arrived, and that advantage must be talren of Rome's
distractions to set up 3 rival Gallie empire, the counterpart of Rome
herself, north of the Alps In furtherance of this design not only were
messengers despatched to all the Gallie tribes to summon them to j0in
the insurrection, but it was resolved that attempts should be made to
win over the legions of the Rhine, whom the murder of Hordeonius
Flaccus might seem to have committed to hopeless estrangement from
their felloweountrymen Vocula, informed of these deliberatione, had
no choice but to put a bold face on the matter and to go out to meet,
and if possible to counterworlr, their designs He proceeded first to
Cologne, where he was joined by Tutor and Classicus at the head of
the Gallie auxiliaries, and then striking northward'advanced to the
relief of Vetera, which was still being besieged by Civilis On the
northward march the Gallie commanders, breaking off from him, en-
trenched themselves in a separate camp, and from this opened up com·
munications with the Germans on one side and with Vocula's own
mutinous troops on the other. Vocula, informed of their treachery,
was forced to beat a hasty retreat to Novesium. But the solicitations
of the Gauls, the sense of guilt which the soldiers had ineuned by their
general's murder, and their unwillingness to recognise Vespasian's
authority, had now done their work, and Vocula's own forces were
willing to make their peace with their foes by aclrnowledging the Gallie
Empire and by the sacrifice of their general Vocula was byClassicus’s
order put to death bya deserter Longinus, and no soldier raised 3
weapon in his defence The other legates, Numisius Lupus and
Herennius Gallus, were cast into chains, and the whole army swore
fealty to the Gallie Empire. After this astounding event, unparalleled
as Tacitus says in the whole course of Roman history, envoys were
despatched to Cologne and Mainz on the one side, to Vetera on the
other, to carry the news of what had occurred, and to invite the troops
in either quarter to join a movement which ir might now seem impos·
sible to resist The hrst of these embassies was completely successful.
The Agrippinenses and the soldiers in the upper provinces swore, as
the troops at Novesium had already done, fealty to the Gallie Empire.
In the second ease the gallant defendere of the camp at Vetera, reduced
at length by the extreme of hunger, bargained with Civilis that their
lives should be spared on condition that they too should take the same
oath of allegiance which their comrades had already swom. On these ’
terms they were allowed to leave Vetera with their arms and a garment
apieee ; the camp and all that was in it was to be given up as spoil.
But Civilis found himself either unable or unwilling to stay the fury of
his German followers As the unfortunate Romans lest the camp they
' vere set upon by their ferocious enemies and massacred almost to a
man. With their slaughter disappeared the last remains of the most

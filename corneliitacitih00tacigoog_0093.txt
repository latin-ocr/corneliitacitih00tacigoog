74 THE HISTORIES OF TACITUS sacr.

small a part that it throws but little light on his character, but when
success was assured the character of theman showed itself, and he
sauls into the mere vulgar glutton. The sums which he is said to
have squandered on the pleasures of the table, during his brief tenure
of power, are so prodigious that they would be incredible did they not
come to us backed by the testimony of independent witnesses who
had ceased to have any motive for falsifying the truth. Yet Vitellius
amidst all his gluttony and debauchery was not at first cruel He
proceeded to extremity against very few of the Othonian leaders (ii. 60);
he confiscated but little property, he respected the wills even of those
who had fallen in battle against him at Bedriacum3 he spared Otho's
own brother Titianus The death of Dolabella was, perhaps, rather
wrong from him than deliberately plaaned by him (ii 63, 64). His con·
duct iu Rome itself, though it found critica enough, does not, except that
it was disgraced by debauchery, seem to have been wanting iu good·
humour and lrindliuess If he sought popularity in the theatre and
circus he was doing, after all, only that which his predecessors had also
done (ii 9¹)· At a later date, indeed, under the influence of fear his
character seems to have altered; as treachery thickened around him
he grew suspicions, and suspicion and fear, as is so often the case, bred
· cruelty. His treatment of Junius Blaesus was mean and unjustifiable.
Blaesus had been his benefactor, supplying him with the means of
fitting out a court as he passed through Gallia Lugdunensis on his
way into Italy. In return for this he had him poisoned, listening to
theqmere empty suspicions whispered into his ear by his brother
Lucius, and the most worthless of his courtiers (iii. 38, 39). In the
closing scenes of his reign the conduct of Vitellius was wanting alike in
dignity, energy, and courage Had be possessed either of the last two
qualities, the taslc of defending Italy and Rome even aster the defeat of
Bedriacum was by no means an impossible one. ,The passes of the
Apennines could have been made good and held against the invader;
his soldiers were still, if he would only have allowed them to he
so, devoted to his person and his cause, and had strength and vigour
⁸enough left to render them formidable opponents. The desperate
stand, when all seemed lost, which they made iu Rome itselfis a proof
of what they could have done had they only been decently led. But
Vitellius threw away chance aller chance In the first instance, while
there was yet time to have amended matters, he refused to recognise
or to divulge the facts (iii. 54); when he had at last organised an army
he declined to accompany it himself 3 induced, at last, to join it hythe
pressure of the soldiers, he stays with it only for a little time and then
returns to Rome. His desertion scaled the fate of the troops he had
left behind; feeling themselves forsaken, unled‚ desperate, they yielded,
though with obvious reluctance, and passed over to the enemy. At
Rome Vitellius himself would fain have retired from the conflict and
left the city and the empire to be taken possession of without a struggle

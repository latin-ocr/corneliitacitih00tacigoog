their conquests either to the North or West wales and the district

Paulinus was recalled shortly after the uprising, and his two successors,

Maximus was still in command when the Civil War hroke out Tacitus
describes him (Ag. 16) as “slothful and with no experience of camp
life, one who excused himself from either exercising discipline over his
troops or attaching the enemy on 'the plea of the Civil War.’' Trebel·
lius's difficulties were further added to hy the turbulence of one of his
subordinates, Caelius, legate of the aoth legion. Caelius accused him of
ruining the province by his avarice and want of energy (H. i. 6ο).
Trebellius retorted on Caelius that he was undermining discipline by his
unruly conduct Matters had gone almost to the length of an armed
quarrel between the two when a deputation arrived from the German
army inviting the forces of Britain to throw themselves into the cause
of Vitellius · To this invitation the legions seem to have listened, and
Trebellius, fearing personal violence from his mutinous troops, fled for
refuge to Vitellius In his absence Britain was ruled by the legates of
the legions (H. i 6ο). Vitellius alter a time sent Vettius Bolanus
to talre over the command which Trebellius's llight had left vacant
(tt ii 6 5); but Bolanus, though he managed to secure the goodwill of
his soldiers, showed little more energy than his predecessor, and neither
extended the Roman dominions in the island nor took any active part
in the Civil War. When Vitellius at a later date, frightened by the
guthering clouds in the East, summoned assistance from Britain, Bolanus
hesitated, but seems so far to have listened to his request that detach-
ments of the three British legions—the ad, 9th, and aoth—are men·

the r4th, whom Vitellius thought it safer to send baclr after the first
battle of Bedriacum hut their Batavian auxiliaries refused to accom-
pany them and remained behind in Gaul (ii 66). In the midst ol
the Civil War a revolt occurred in Britain itself, though it did not attain
very formidahle proportions It was headed by Venutius, husband of
Cuthmandua, queen of the Brigantes (in Yorkshire). Cartismandua had
been for a long while the faithful friend of the Romans, and had sur·

headed the opposition to their advance in southern Britain (Ann xii.

rose in revolt against her, and pressed her so hard that she had to
seelr assistance from Rome (lt iii 45). The war lingered on during
the last months of 69 and the whole of 70 sn, but was not sufficiently

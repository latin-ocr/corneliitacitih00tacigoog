60 THE HISTORIES OF TACITUS sacr.

a while hesitated, doubtful whether he had at his command forces
sufficient to meet the renowned armies of Germany (ii 74, 75). A
speech of Mucianus, delivered at Berytus, where he had gone to
meet him, at last decided him. Immediately after their parting he
returned to Caesarea, and then his soldiers meeting him informally
g proclaimed him emperor. Within tvro days all Syria had swom
allegiance to him, Egypt had already joined him, and Sohaemus,
prince of Emessa, Antiochus, king of Commagene, and Agrippa 11
(having made good his escape from Rome), had given in their adhesion
to him. At a council of war held at Berytus it was ¹settled that Titus
should remain behind to conduct affairs in Judaea, that Mucianus
should undertake the advance on Italy, while Vespasian himself re
paired to Egypt, where in the person of its praefect, Tiberius Alexander,
henas already possessed of a staunch ally. The story of the Judaic
war is left incompleta in that part of the Historias which has come down
tous, though in the beginning of Book V we have an invaluable
fragment upon it. During the year 69 au. nothing was accomplished,
only the conquesta already made good were retained and the position
‚of the army in front of Jerusalem not abandoned (v. ιο). At the
beginning of the year 70 AD. Titus, with a force considerably increased
beyond that which his father had commanded, commenoed the siege.
He had the three legions which had served under his father-the yth,
roth, and r5th, and received in addition the rath from Syria and por-
tions of the *aad and the gd Germanice from Alexandria (v. ι). After
a number of skinnishes, not always favourable to the Romans, the
defendere were at last driven within the walls. The Romans settled
not to starve out the city, but to taire it by storm. Titus's ambition
for military glory and his eagemess to get back to the pleasures of
Rome were believed to have contributed to this determination. The
natural strength of the place, and the formidabis charactetof the for-
tifications, made the task of stonning it one of no ordinary difficulty.
From the north alone could the enterprise be attempted with any
chance of success, and here a triple wall had been erected With
desperate energy each wall was defended, but the fection rights within
the city when John of Giscala, Simon, and Eleazar had entrenched
themselves at different points made the task of the assailants easier.
The walls were gradually stormed ; then the Temple fell; last of all
Mount Zion was captured Iu the course of the struggle the Temple
and almost the whole city were consumed in the flames, and the
Romans resolved that it should nothe rebuilt. At the close of the
war Roman policy towards the Jews completely altered Hitherto
they had been treated with tolerance, at any rate in the East, had been
allowed much liberty, and had had the almost complete control of their
. own religious affairs3 alike in Palestine and in the cities throughout the
East they had been pennitted to form themselves into aelf-governing
communities. Now, not only were they forbidden to rebuild the Temple

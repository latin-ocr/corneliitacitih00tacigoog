ing from the confines of Pontus on the north to those of Cilicia (which
= now belonged to the province of Syria) on the south. From the latter
country it was separated by the ranges of Taurus and Amanus On
the esst it was separated by the Euphrates from Armenia, which was
still independdnt Tiberius, when he took over the province, proposed
tonse its resourcesin order to diminish by onehalf the tax on sales,
yet it seems to have been on the whole a poor disuict (though far more
thriving under Roman rufe than it bas ever been since), and contained
only two towns of importance, Caesarea (or Mazaca), the capital, and
Tyana In the war, like the rest of Asia Minor, it threw its weight on
the side of Vespasian (ii. 81), but its adhesion was of less importance
than rt would bave been afterwards when it had obtained from Ves
pasian a permanent garrison of two legions.

(4) The province of Galatia was formed out of the earlier
Galatian kingdom by Augustus, ²5 sc, aller the death of its king
⁸ Amyntas, successor of Deiotarus. The province consisted of two parts
-Galatia proper, on the two sides ol the Halys, with a Celtic popula-
tion divided into three tribes of Tectosages, Tolistoboii, and Trocmi,
who centred round the three towns of Ancyra, Pessinos, and Tavia ;
and secondly, the widelying district of Lycaonia to the south and east,
which extended to the confines of Cilicia and Pamphylia This latter
district, inhabited not bya Celtic but by an Asiatic race, had been
annexed to his dominions by Amyntas, whom Antony had employed to
repress the brigandage and piracy which was rife in that part of the
world Augustus in constituting his new province retained the existing

arrangement, merely handing over to Pamphylia such parts of the coast ’

districtas could not be conveniently govemed from Galatia The
further to repress the brigandage and piraey from which the district
sull'ered he established in Lycaonia a number of colonies of Roman
veterans-Antioch and Cremna in Pisidia, Parlais in Southem Lycaonia,
Iconium, added to afterwards by Claudius, a place of considerable
trade, and farther east Comana The region, though poor and always
apt to be disturbed, attained by means of these settlements a fair
measure of order and prosperity. Galba placed the province of Galatia
and its neighbour Pamphylia under a single governor, Calpurnius As-
prenas (ii. 9). It was by his energy that the pretended Nero was sup
pressed and captured. Galatia had no regular army quartered in it,
but its inhabitants and those of Lycaonia were accounted far braver
than the neighbouring Greeks and Asiatica (Cic. ad Art. vi. 5, 3),
and were largely drawn upon for recruits by the Roman commandere
(5) The coast regions of Lycia and Pamphylia, which since Claudius’s
time had been united under a single command, though their formation
into a province bada considerable effectio suppressing piracy, were
notin themselves important. They were at this time an imperialpro
vince and ruled by a procurator. The chief towns were-in Lycia,

86 THE HISTORIES OF TA CITUS suc'r.

lining a field path3 beyond thern stood the 3d, covered by brushwood
and low trees. This was the order of the colours, but in the darkness the
men of the different regimenta got much mixed up. With the 3'd were
drawn up a detachment of praetoriana 3 the auxiliaries were stationed
at either extremity of the line, and beyond them again “’ the cavalry pro
tected flanlrs and rear. It would have been easy for the Vitellians, as
Tacitus points out, to have waited quietly within their entrenchments
till the morning, and then have overwhelmed an enemy whom they
would have found wearied out bya night-watch and a long fast. In
place of this, having no general to guide or direct. them, they exposed
themselves to all the dangers of a night attack on an enemy ready
drawn up and fully prepared to meet them The exact order of their
line Tacitus believes it to be impossible to ascertain, but he gives the
following as resting on some authority. Their right wing, which would
be to the south of the Postumian road as they advanced eastward from
Cremona, was occupied by the 4th, the yth, and the 1 5th 3 detachments
of the three British legions, the 9th, ad, and aoth, made the centre of
the line, while the 16th, the aad, and the rst took their position on the
left. The soldiersof thearst and therst (Italica) were mixed up hopelessly ·
¹ all along the front. The cavalry aud auxiliary troops selected positions
for themselves. The engagement was fought with much obstinacy, the
yth (Galbiana) on the Flavian side suffering especially. The praetorians
had at last to be called up from their position on the lert wing to their
aid But as theygcrossed the Postumian road they were nearlygawept
away by a huge engine the Vitellians had succeeded in statiomngon
itrand were only saved hythe intrepidity of two soldiers who, at the
cost of their own lives, succeeded in cutting the repes with which it
was worked and so rendering it useless. At last, however, the moon
rose, and the light falling full on the faces of the Vitellians threw the
Flavians into shadow, and so speedily gave a considerable advantage to
the latter. Antonius saw his opportunity, and seized it for a final effert.
Urging on his men by every motive which could appeal to thern he led

further dispirited hya mmour which got about that Mucianus was
coming up with fresh reinforcements.' As soon as he saw an impres-
sion had been made he assaulted the enemy with redoubled vigour;
and the wavering and practically leaderless line of the Vitellians was
as a consequence quickly driven in headlong tlight in the direction ol
Cremona No quarter was given or asked, and the whole road was
strewn with the corpses of the slain. The larger force had succumbed
to the smaller, but it was the absence of generals and advisers rather
than any want of courage on the part of the German troops which
had caused their overthrow. Had the German army been even
decently led, it would hardly have found itself the vanquished in the
light Antonius had to thank the treachery of Caecina even more
than his own skill and bravery, considerable though those were, for

the Neckar, were also already included within the province, though
the line of forts by which the district was subsequently defended
was not built till Flavian times, and the Lines (or barricade of earth)
connecting the frontier of the Rhine with that of the Danube, was not
constructed till some time later. Only three legions belonged at this
time to the army of Upper Germany. Two of them, the ath Macedonica
and the aad, stationed at Mogontiacum or Mainz; while the other,
the arst, was at Vindonissa (W indiscb) in Westem Switzerland Mogon-
tiacum was the military capital of the upper as Vetera was of the lower
province lt commanded the entrance of the valley of the Maius the
second great highway leading up into the plains and forests of central
Germany. As tbe legions of lower, so the legions of Upper Germany
were recruited mainly from the neighbouring tribes, and tbeir auxiliary
forces were also drawn from the same districts. lt was this which gave
to thern their particularly dangerous and unstable character. When
the legions which accompanied Vitellius and had made him emperor
marched into Rome they seemed to the Romans little else than bar·
barians, marked out as such by their foreign tongue, their dress of
skins, their huge stature, their shaggy hair, and enormous weapons (ii.
88). The incapacity they showed to withstand the deadly climate of
Rome points also to ⁴their northern origin After proclaiming Vitellius
emperor the great maiority of the soldiers of both armies accompanied
either his two lieutenants or the emperor himself into Italy. There
many of them were allowed to enrol themselves in the praetorian guard,
and avalled themselves of the privilege Undaunted by Caecina's
treachery they remained faithful to the emperor they had chosen, and
though left without a general fought in his interests with stubborn
valour tbe second battle of Bedriacum. The same valour they displayed
at that time they displayed again before the gates and in the streets of
Rome Their final defence of the praetorian camp cost their foes many
abrave soldier,‚and at the last “they were more deserted by their
emperor than deserted him'’ At length the bones of most of them
lay whitening on the plains of Italy or in the streets of R‘ome, while in
the frontier camps there remained only their names and hastily-raised
recruits to talre their place lt is scarcely wonderful if under these
circumstances the Germans regarded it as a favourable opportunity
to try conclusione with their ancient adversary, and the Gauls were
tempted to assert their liberty aod to seek to gain redress for the
manifold wrongs they had suffered lately at the hands of the neigh-
bouring armies The armies and their commanders bad sown the
wind, and were to reap the whirlwind.

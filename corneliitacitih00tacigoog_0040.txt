(c) Qus Messalla M. He was a friend of Tacitus in his
youth, and both in the Daulogve (c ις) and in the AEstories (iii. 9) is
greatly praised by him. In the last passage he speaks of him “as
a man of high descent” (in the Dialogve, c 27, majores tui
probably refers to Valerius Messalla), “himself distinguished, the
only man who brought to ,this war (between Vitellius and Vespasian)
good principles.” In that war he was tribune of the seventh legion
(Claudiana), a legion which formed part of the Moesian army, and
joined Antonius Primus in Northern Italy. As commender of this legion
he took an active part¹ in the campaign which followed, in the second
battle of Bedriacum, and in the storming of Cremona It is for these
events that he is cited as an authority by Tacitus (iii. 2 5, 28). But
it is most likely that our author was also indebted to him for the
details relating to the advance of the Flavian army towards Rome as
well as for the operatione which went on in the immediate neighbour-
hood of the capital That he accompanied the victorious army to
Rome is clear from the mention of him in iv. 42, where it is recorded
that he gained great fame by pleading the cause of his brother,
Aquilius Regulus, before the Senate.

(d) We have also mentioned as writers whose works covered part of
this period the following-(1) Fabius Rusticus, refened to more than
onee as an authority in the later books of the Annals (xiii. 20, xiv. a,
xv. 61). As he lived to 108 or 109 an. he may have given some account
of the events of 69 and the following years, but no mention is made of
him in the Ha’stories. Nor is there any reference to (ἶῖξιῖὧηίυε Paulinus
asa writesthdugu he is· often mentioned as a general. He, too, is
said to have composed military mernoirs, and it is possible, of course,
that Tacitus borrowed frorn him. Pliny in his Natural History quotes
(3) M Licinius Crassus Mucianus (the celebrated governor of Syria, i 10,
who was mainly responsible for raising Vespasian to the throne) as an
authority for many facts bearing on geography and natural history in
the East What was the exact character of the work from which
these quotations are made we do not know, nor does Tacitus anywhere
refer to him as one of his authorities. That, however, he was not
unacquainted with his writings is clear from the mention in Dial. 37
of another book of his-a collection which he made of speeches
delivered in Republican times-which he published together with three
volumee of his own letters To Mucianus Tacitus may have owed
some of the facts stated with regard to the geography of Palestine and
thetopography of Jerusalem.

Resides these purely literary sources of inforn'ration there were others
of a documentary rather than a literary character to which Tacitus had
aocess, and which he largely employed at any rate in the composition

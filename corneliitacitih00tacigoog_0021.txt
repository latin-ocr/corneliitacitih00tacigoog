2 THE HISTORIES OF TA CITUS secr.

4. Codex Budensis was written at the end of the fifteenth century
for Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary and Bohemia, from a more
ancient MS. at Floreuce From him it went to Vladislaus the Second,
who gave it to Spiegel¹ amanuensis to Maximilian3 Spiegel in turn pre-
sented it to Rhenanus. To it Rhenanus attached much value‚ but
Lipsius, who also examined-it, considered it of comparatively little worth.
There was another MS. also made for Matthias Corvinus, called Sam·
buci or vindobonensis, still at Vienna It agrees generally with the
first Vatican MS, and still more closely witb Spira’s original edition,
indeed so closely that Spita must have used either this MS or the
original from which it is talen

5. Codex Guelferbytanus, so called from the library of Wolfen·
blittel, near Brunswiclr, where it is at present It was written in Italy
aner the middle of the fifteenth century. It contains much curious ⁴
orthography, but agrees iu its text generally with the two Oxford MSS.

6. There is aParisian MS. (sometimes called Codex Regius), which
dates from the latter part of the fifteenth century. Its text agrees very
closely with the edition of De Spira

7, 8. Το this same period belong two Oxford MSS, one in the
Bodleian, the other in Jesus College Library, first collatedby J. F.
Gronovius. Both these are dated, the first at the eud having the
same subscription as the third Vatican quoted above, the latter at
H. iii 34, where this note is added, “Hodie autern ab ortu Creatoris
sunt anni MCCCCLVIII.’'

All these, however (except, perhaps, the two first Vatican, for
which Lipsius was inclined to claim original authority, and a Spanish
MS. which he equally highly prized), are of secondary importance.
They seem, as already stated, to be all copies of the Medicean, and
almost their only value is that they have enabled the critics in some
instances to correct the mistalres into which individuals among them
have fallen, and to restore in a few cases a reading which has been
obliterated in the Medicean itself. ·

Tacitus was one of the earliest classical authors to command the
attention of scholars at the revival of learning in the fifteenth cen·
tury. This was natural lt was as models of style that the works of
the ancients were at that time most eagerly studied, and such a master
of style as Tacitus was not likely long to escape notice. Accordingly
we find a whole series of editions of Tacitus appearing in Italy before
the close of the fifteeuth century. The earliest of these editions was
published at Venice in 1468 ab. It appeared without date or place
of publication, but ha'd instead the following lines appended :-

Iste tibi codex ς Historie Pater est,

Insigni quem laude feret gens postera ς pressit
Spira premens: artis gloria prima suae.

¹The province of Africa first passed into the possession of the
' Romans on the fall of Carthago at the close of the third Punic war. As
originally constituted the provin'ee was very small, the greater part of
the Carthaginian possessione being ceded 'to Masinissa, king of Nu·
midia, and incorporated in his dominions The reorganisation of the
province was due to Julius Caesar. He refounded Carthage which
soon, as a consequenoe of its position, became one of the most thriving
cities of the Empire, and annexed to the province of Africa most of the
Numidian kingdom of Juba 1, who had taken a leading part in the
Civil War against him. Within the province of Africa was included
also the district of Tripolis to the East Augustus at the division ot
the provinces handed it over to the Senate, and it becanm from that

these being Utica, the earliest, and Carthage. Other cities with Latin or
Italian rights were soon added, till at last such Roman, Latin, and
Italian municipalities largely took the place of the earlier Phoenician
towns with which the country had been thickly studded At the same
time the Iatin language supplanted the Phoenician and the original

Mauretanias, constituting them two distinct procuratorial commanda ;
in the second place he appointed an imperial legate to command the
legion and the auxiliary forces, by which· the frontier was protected, side
by side with the senatorial proconsul That which gave to Africa and
its governor their interest in the eyes of the princeps was the important
plaoe the province held in relation to the com-supply of Rome One-
third of the whole yearly supply of the city came from this district,
which was renowned alike for its fertility and for the large slave-worked

Atthis point the Othonian leaders helda council of war. ¹ It is not
clear lrom Tacitus’s account whether Otho himself was present at the
council or no, though his language on the wholeimplies that he was
there Plutarch, however, expressly states that he came up irom'
Brixellum sor the council, and only retired when immediate action had
been decided on. In the council opinions were divided. The three
competent generals, Suetonius Paulinus, Marius Celsus, and Annius
Gallus (prevented by a sall from his horse lrom being present in person),
were all lor delay. Otho himself, his brother Titianus, and Proculus,
the commander ol the praetorian guard, advocated immediate action.
There is no doubt that the former opinion was the wise one, and that
strategically Otho and his colleagues were wrong; at the same time it
was not unnatural that the'y should have dreaded the opportunities 'lor
treachery which delay would bring with it and the chance that the
army might thus be betrayed by its own generals, The resolution
which allowed Otho, instead os appearing in personat the head ol his
troops, to wait the issue ol events at Brixellum probably carried with
it all the evil consequences which Tacitus attributes to it There is
one fatal omission in the narrative oi Tacitus which preventa us from
judging how sar the decision of Otho and his friends amounted to
downright loolhardiness: our historian nowhere tells us the number
os troops who had already arrived on the scene, and who were therefore
in a position to take part in the battle. That the Moesian legions had
not come up be expressly states3 that only a part ol the r4th was
present he enables us to inser with certainty; but whether the remaining
Dalmatian legion and the two Pannonian legions were present in whole
or in part he leaves doubtful. On the whole, it seems more probable
that only part ol them had arrived But even if we suppose that the
whole ol them had corne up, and acoept his statement that the recruits
from the classia' amounted to a very large number (though he seems
inclined to malre thern do double duty in different passages), the forces
ol the Othoniana must still have been in number greatly inferior to
their opponente ·

While the Othoniana were holding council, the Vitellians waited on
in their camp outside the walls ol Cremona and busied themselves with
the construction ol a bridge over the Po, which would give them acoess
to the southern bank. During the construction of the bridge a
skirmish occurred between some ol Otho's gladiators and the Germana
on the northern bank. The object ol contention was a small island in
the middle of the river nearly opposite the mouth ol the Adda, which
would be a valuable acquisition to whichever side could succeed in
occupying it. The slrirmish ended in a victory lor the Germana, whose
slrill in swimming enabled them to outstrip the enemy and to meet
them at an advantage as they attempted to land lrorn their unsteady
vessels The gladiators avenged themselves by laying all the blame ol
their deleat on their commander Macer, whom they almost murdered

20 THE HISTORIES OF TACITUS secr.

Thus he embraced all the wars which have ever been waged with the
Germans in twenty volumes, and also completed a Natural ffrstoty in
thirtyseven books. He died in the disaster of Campania; for being
in command of the fleet of Misenum, and having when Vesuvius was
in eruption approached in his ship somewhat too near with a view of
ascertaining the causes, be was overwhelmed by the dust and ashes, or,
as some think, killed by his slave whom he had besought, when sainting
from the heat, to hasten his death” His nephew, Pliny the younger,
tells us that bis works were composed in the following order (Epp iii 5).
One book, De Jaculatr'one Equestn’, written while he was still holding
a cavalry command in Germany. Two volumes, De isira Pomponi
,Secundi the life of a friend Twenty books of Wars with Gmnuny, in
which he collected all the wars that Rome had waged with the Germans.
“He began it when on service in Germany, urged thereunto bya
dream ; there stood by him while he slept the ghost of Drusus Nero,
who, after winning the most important victories in Germany, died
there. Drusus commended his memory to him and prayed him to
rescue him from oblivion'’ Three books of Studiosi, divided into six
volumes on account of their size, in which he depicts the perfect
orator from his cradle onwards Eight books, Dubri' Sermone, written
in the later years of Nero. Thirtyene books, A Fine Aufidii Bassi,
a continuation of the Histoaey of Aufidius Bassus Thirty-seven books
of Natural History, “a work diffuse and learned and not less varied
than is Nature herself.” The two books used by Tacitus are the
Accaus! of the Wars with Gemnony, which, as we have seen, he
probably employed in the composition of the account of the revolt
of Civilis, and the thirtyone books in continuation of the Hisfory of
Aufidius Bassus, which he probably used throughout his Hr'sforics.
He twice refers to it asan authority, once directly (iii. 28) when
discussing who was responsible for the buming and sack of Cremona,
and again indirectly (ii τοι) where, dwelling on the causes which
led to Caecioa's treachery, he mentions that the writers of history, who
when the Flavian House was in power composed memoirs of thiswar,
set it down toa desire of peace and to patriotism—a view which Tacitus
himself does not share. That Pliny was among the writers here
referred to seems to follow from the fact that in his Hr'stosy he describes
Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian, and that be wrote as a friend of all
three (N. H. Prael ao). Pliny (Epp. v. 8, 5) claims for this work of his
uncle, and adopted father, the merit of the utmost scrupulosity3 and
that it possessed this merit we may well believe. To this work
Tacitus must have been indebted for a good deal of his information;
that he used it, however, merely as raw material, recasting its form,
and imparting to it even a wholly different spirit, is certain from what
we know of the two writers. Pliny wrote more or less asa partisan of
the Flavian House; Tacitus had no such sympathies. That Pliny rather
than Cluvius was the author whom Plutarch, Tacitus, and Suetonius

94 THE HISTORIES OF TACITUS sacr.

Novesium, where Hordeonius had for the present fixed his head·
quarters. This was a work of difficulty, as the Germana were now
in possession of the river. The first convoy, however, got safely

, through, but the second was attacked ¹by Civilis and atter some

resistance captured, the escort being forced to seelr arefuge in Gelduba
Vocula thereupon, apprehensive apparently lest the full garrison should
be straitened for want of food, marched out from Vetera not merely
at the head of the-troops which he had brought with him, but Joined
besides by detachments of the 5th and 15th legions, part of the
original defenders of Vetera. He succeeded in making good his
retreat to Novesium, though the scanty forces left behind in the camp
complained with good reason that they were being deserted by him
Arrived at Novesium his troops did but add to the tumult already
seething there The soldiers heard that money had come from
Vitellius, and clamoured at once that it should be divided amongst
thern. Hordeonius, not daring to refuse, distributed it as a donative
from Vespasian, The soldiers aller receiving it, maddened by drink
and excitement, dragged Hordeonius from his bed and murdered him
under cover of the darkness. Vocula avoided a similar fate only by
escaping in the disguise of a slave The soldiers, after Hordeonius’s
death, pretended to justify themselves by taking a fresh oath of
allegiance to Vitellius,v though he, as a matter of fact, had already
fallen.

After this foul deed a brief period of repentance seems to have set
in, all the more because Civilis still threatenedthem, and dissensions
soon diselosed themselves among the mutineers. The legions of Upper
Germany severing themselves from their colleagues of the lower pro
vince followed Vocula, who had retreated southwards, and placing
themselves once more under his command and taking afresh an oath of
allegiance to Vespasian were led by him to the relief of Mogontiacum,
which was at this time being besieged by a motley crowd from the
other side of the Rhine. On them the Roman forces fell unexpectedly
and succeeded in driving them with considerable loss back into their
own country. At Mogontiacum Vocula stayed for the remainder of
the winter.

At this point the insurrection began to assume a wider and a more
dangerous character. Gaul had remained hitherto faithful to the
Romans, and the solicitations of Civilis addressed to itschiefs had
fallen for the most part on deaf ears At many points successful
resistance had even been offered to the Germana. But the sight of
Rome's divisions, the mutinous conduct of ¹her troops, above all the
destruction of the Capitol, accepted as portending the doom of the
Empire, had produced a profound impression; and the northern tribes
at any rate began now to waver. Julius Classicus, commander ofa'
squadron of Treveran horse; Julius Tutor, another distinguished
member of the same tribe ; and Julius Sabinus, a Lingon chief, met

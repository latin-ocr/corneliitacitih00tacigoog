1 INTRODUCTION ³

The last line gives the clue alike to author and date. John and Vende-
linus de spira published at Venice in 1469 a splendid edition of Pliny.
That the Tacitus also was their work the last line demonstrates, and
the edition of Tacitus being described as·“ artis gloria prima suae ’⁹ ·
must have come out before the Pliny 3 therefore not later than 1468.
In this edition the Agn'cola, as well as the first six books of the Annals
(which had not yet been discovered), were wanting. Tm text agrees
so closely with that found in the Codex sambuci, both edition and text
ending with the words “magnitudine potiorem '' in c ²3 of Boolr
V, rie. three chapters earlier than most of the other MSS.‚ that it seems
almost certain that both MS. and edition were based on thesaure
original.

The next edition was published at Milan some ten years later. Its
editor was one Franciscus Puteolanus, aprofessor of oratoryof note in that
city. Puteolanus was a fervent admirer of Tacitus, and describes him as
the Prince of Historians, ‘⁸ the skill of whose language vas only surpassed
by the pungency and truthfulness of the thoughts to which it gave
expression.” It was the enthusiasm aroused by his eloquent elogium
of our author which led to that more diligent search for his writ'ings,
which resulted in the discovery of the first Medicean MS. in the
monastery of Fulda in Hesse Cassel, or of Ciirvey in westphalia The
task of publishing this new-found treasure was entrusted by Leo X to
Philippus Beroaldus, head of the Academia Romana at Rome, whose
edition of Tacitus, including the first six books of the Annals, appeared
in the year 1515. ·

The earliest non-Italian edition was published by Beatus Rhenanus
at aare in 1519, and a second edition appeared in 1533. Rhenanus
based his original edition mainly on the edition of Beroaldus, his
second edition, as we have already said, on a recension of the Codex
Budensis

Rhenanus’s editions were,‚however, soon surpassed in fame by
those which the Belgian Lipsius published in rapid succession between
1574 and the close oi the century. Lipsius, called by his contem·
poraries Sospitator Taciti, made use of afar more complete apparatus
maiar than any of his predecessore He collated, as he tells usin
his preface to his fourth edition, the two Vatican MSS.‚ the Codex
Farnesianusa Codex Covarruviae, notes on which he got taken for him
in Spain, and various other MSS. Being a man of sound sense, of
great learning, and an enthusiastic student of Tacitus, his notes and
critical emendations have a permanent value, and have been drawn upon
by almost all later editors

Nearly contemporary with Lipsius was Piehena His first edition
appeared at Frankfort in 1607, asecond in 1619. Pichena founded
his text mainly on a fresh recension of the Medicean, which he often
corrected most ingeniously in places where it was obviously in error.
A great number oi his corrections of the Medicean text have approved

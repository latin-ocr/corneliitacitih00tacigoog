should have been able to present to his readers a picture which, if not
precise in all respecta nor always exact, gives a fair representation
of the country as a whole, and a not untrustworthy survey of the main
races and peoples hy which it was occupied

Some fifteen years separated the appearance of the Anaols from ,

that of the Historias. When the earlier work was composed, the latter
had not been even thought of. Its composition was thus, with Tacitus,
an after thought In the introduction to his Ha'stora'cs he had indeed
already expressed himself dissatislied with the way in which the story
of the reigns of Tiberius and of Caius, of Claudius and Nero, had been
told Those who wrote accounts of them had been either partisans
, or opponents; they had sought either to curry favour or to gratify hate
and spite, neither one set nor the other had any true regard for
posterity, any real reverence for truth. But he was not then proposing
to set right the errors which he saw and deplored3 rather he contem·
plated, if his life was spared, to recount the reigns of Nerva and of
Trajan-“those happy and glorious times when men were ableto think
what they liked and say what they thought '¹ (H. i. r). What induced him
to alter his determination, and to cast his glauce backward instead of for-
ward from the period covered by the Historias, we do not know. lt may
have been that the task of writing nearly contemporary history proved
less secure and lesa easy than he had anticipated3 perhaps he found it
hard to maintain for the later period that high standard of impartiality
which his theory of the duties of an historiari required3 or again it is
possible that the earlier period may have scemed to him on reflection
more full of examples for warning, of instances for imitation, more
prolific of moral, social, and political lessons, than was the more sunny
and prosperous age of Nerva and of Trajan. It may be also that the
dark features of that earlier time seemed more congenial to his own
gloomy and unhopeful disposition. He himself alleges in the Annals,
as his reason for undertaking the work, his desire to present anim-
partial picture of a period which had never yet received from previous
writers such treatment It was the carrying out for an earlier time of
the task which he hoped and flattered himself he had successfully
accomplished for the years covered by the Historias-that rs, for the
period of the flavian dynasty and the year which ushered it in.
Posterity has, however, on the whole, pronounced that the same success
has not attended the later as the earlier attempt, that both artistically
and historically the latet is less successful than the earlier work-
artistically because the form adopted in the Annals allowed him less
freedom of treatment and less variety of detail than he had secured in
the Haitories; historically because, while there has been indeed the
· saum anxiety to arrive at truth, the same silling of materials and weigh·
ing of evidence, yet partly owing to the fact that he has been able to

depend less on personal observation and mquiry, and has had to have
recourse more to the written accounts of others, partly also to the epoch

36 THE HISTORIES OF TACITUS sacr.

they had been intended hy Augustus to be provinces proper embracing
all the country from the Rhine to the Elbe, but the defeat of Varus
had induced him to relinquish most of the district beyond the Rhine,
retaining only so much of it as was necessary for the defence of the
frontier. At the beginning of Tiberius's reign Germanicus had indeed
been allowed to resume for a time a forward policy3 but his campaigns
’ were not wholly successful, and Tiberius had himself at last interfered
to repress the movement, and Germanicus was sent off on service else·
where. Claudius had further abandoned whatever possessione the
Romans retained on the right bank of the lower Rhine, and the
northern province became restricted to the country which lay between
the northeastem frontier of Gaul and the Rhine itself The limita
thus left to it were comparatively narrow. It embraced the tribes of
the Menapii, Tungri, Cugerni, Ubii, and the Batavi and Caninefatev in
their island. It thus extended over what is now Belgium and a small
part of North-Eastem France and Western Germany. The boundary
between it and⁴ the southern province was between Andemach and
Remagen, near Brohl,.so that Cologne and Bonn belonged to the
northern, Bingen and Coblenz to the upper province The civil
capital of the northern province was Cologne (Colonia Agrippinensis),
called after Agrippina, daughter of Germanicus and mother of Nero.
Its earlier name had been Ara Ubiorum, and it had been, perhaps,
designed to occupy the same position in relation to a Germanic federa-
tion which Lugdunum held with reference to the Gauls The plan,
however, was, as a consequence of the defeat of Varus, never carried
out, and had been by this time entirely abandoned The military
capital was Vetera Castra, lower down the Rhine near Xanthen. This
spot was selected as military centre for two reasons: it occupied the
first high ground rising from the level plain through which the Rhine
runs in its lower course, and it was situated exactly opposite the valley
of the Lippe, which furnishes the most convenient accere to the interior
of Northem Germany. Two legions were permanently encamped here,
a third at Novesium (Neuss),a fourth at Bonna (Bonn). The four
· legions comprising the Lower army at this time were the rst (Ger-
manica) with its headquarters at Bonn, the 5th (Macedonica) and
the 15th Primigenia belonging to Vetera, and the 16th Primigenia to
Novesium These legions would seem to have been mainly recruited
among the neighbouring tribes, whether Gallie or German.

The upper province was of greater extent than the lower. It in·
cluded the following tribes-the Rauraci, round Bate in Western
Switzerland, the Triboci in Alsace, the Lingones and Sequani round
Langres and Besangon in Eastem France, the Nemetes in the country
round Spires on both banks of the Rhine, and north of them the Van·
giones south of Mainz in the district round Wonns. It is further
likely that the Mattiaci in the lower valley of the Main and in the
district of Wiesbaden, and the “Agri decumates'’ in the region of

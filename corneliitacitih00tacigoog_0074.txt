munands in the Roman world Naturally it was a command the
disposal of which the emperor kept in his own hands. It was more
important than,the two commands in Germany in this way, that while

the military force with which the commanders were entrusted was the ’

same, four legions in each case, the two commanda in Germany,
besides acting to some extent as a check on one another, were almost
exclusively military, as the civil district attached to each was corn-
paratively small and unimportant, whereas in Syria the control ofa
rich and important province was combined with the military command
The Syrian command further resembled the German commanda in this,
that in both cases the governors were responsible for the defence of
the frontier and for the control of an important district within it The
legions in the two Germanies maintained, on the one hand, the frontier
against the Germana, and on the other, were actually though not nomin-
ally entrusted with the preservation of order throughout the Gauls3 so
the Syrian legions were at once responsible for the defence of the
Euphrates frontier against the Parthians, and also kept in such order as
they oould the turbulent province in which their headquarters were situ· “
ated. There was, however, one difference between the German forces
and the Syrian, that the German forces were mainly gathered in great
military camps, Vetera for the lower, Mogontiacum for the upper
province, while the Syrian legions, though they had detachments along
the frontier and along the borders of the eastern desert, had their
headquarters and were permanently stationed in the towns of Syria
itself, above all at Antioch, which, like Alexandria, required the
presence of 'a military force to keep'it in anything like order. This
fact acted most detrimentally on the discipline arrd morals of the
Syrian troops, and an ‘energetic general like Corbulo had first to
accustom his soldiers, corrupted by their town life, to habits of order
and discipline, before he ventured to lead them against the enemy.
The great mass of the population hy which Syria was occupied
belonged to the same Semitic stock as the Jews, but before the Romans ¹
entered the country this native population had been already largely
Hellenised The land had come within the wide extent of Alexander’s
dominions, and alter his death his successore, the Seleucidae, had set
themselves in earnest to impart Greek civilisation to the native popula·
tion. Everywhere throughout the country they had founded towns
on the Greek model, or had reorganised in accordance with Greek .
ideas towns already existing. Alike to their new foundations and
to the previouslyexisting Syrian cities they had given Greek names,
though in the latter case the old Syrian names often subsisted side by
side with the never Greek appellation. Even the famous towns of the
Syrian coast received like the rest a Greek organisation But though
Greek political institutions were thus made everywhere to prevail, the
Syrian tongue remained the common language of the country and the
Syrian gods remained, at least among the common people, the popular

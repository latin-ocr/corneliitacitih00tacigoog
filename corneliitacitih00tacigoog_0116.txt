message to the Treveri recommending them to lay down their arms and
to come to terms with the Romans while it was still possible3 they
were further warned that no assistance was to be looked for from the
Gauls generally. Even the Treveri and the Lingones themselves vere
now only half-hearted in the cause3 the very chiefs who had headed
the insurrection seemed paralysed and incapable of concerting common
measures for resistance to the foe Civilis was away in the west of
Gaul, conducting in that quarter a vain hunt after his compatriot
Claudius Labeo. Classicus at home did nothing but adopt the airs of
a ready-made emperor. Tutor, on whom devolved the taslr of defend·
ing the Rhine frontier, failed egregiously in this object The arst
legion broke in from Vindonissa, one band of auxiliaries under the
command of Sextilius Felix found its way across the Rhine from
Raetia, while another troop of horse led'by Julius Briganticus, Civilis's
own nephew, came up from the same quarter. For a moment Tutor
tried to strengthen his hastily·raised levies by enlisting in his service
the legionary troops still quartered at Main23 but as soon as these saw
the well-known Roman eagles and standards they deserted their new
allies and ranged themselves with their old comrades. The same course
was adopted hythe tribes of Alsace‚ whom Tutor had foroed or cajoled
into joining him. best thus alone at the head of his Treveri he found
himself under the necessity of beating a hasty retreat Fora moment
he attempted to make a standon the Nahe in the neighbourhood of
Bingen, but his forces were defeated by the auxiliary troops under
Sextilius, and he had then to fall back into his own country. Here
the troops ordered up to Treves from Novesium and Bonn took the
oath of allegiance to Vespasian, and marched off into the country of
the Mediomatrici (in the neighbourhood of Meta),'a tribe who had ·
remained all through faithful to Rome In order to commit their
countrymen more irretrievably to their cause Valentinus and Tutor
ordered at this juncture the execution of the two legates, Herennius
Gallusarid Numisius Lupus, who had at the time of Vocula’s murder =
been provisionally spared Such was the position of affairs when
Petilius Cerialis tools over the command at Mogontiacum. Refusing

the levies the Gauls offered him, and taking with him only the troops
he had brought from Italy and those which had joined him at Mogon-
tiacum itself, he set out at once against the headquarters of the enemy.
In three days’ march he reached Rigodulum, in the neighbourhood of
Treves, where Valentinus had entrenched himself in the valley and on
the hills The position was at once carried by assault, and Valentinus

and many of the young Treveran nobles were captured by the Roman

. cavalry. Tm next day witnessed the advance of Cerialis iuto Treves

The soldiers clamoured that the place should be destroyed 3 but Cerialis
spared it, addressing to the vanquished a speech in which he set out
the dangers which the Gauls must always lie under from their restless
neighbours the Germans, and the advantages they had enjoyed under

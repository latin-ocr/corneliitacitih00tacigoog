Another striking scene which we shall hardly be wrong in con·

sidering that Tacitus described from personal recollection was Otho's
departure fronr Rome for the seat of war with his praetorians, classici,
gladiators, and attendant train of reluctant senators. The details
are just those which would fix themselves in the memory of an eye-
witness-the look and bearing of Otho himself, the martial ardour of
the troops, the distress and perplexity of the senators summoned to
attend, the obvious terror of some, the vain parade adopted by others,
the anxiety shown by the remainder not to leave behind thern the
comforts and luxuries to which they had grown accustomed in their
life in Rome. We carr imagine, too, Tacitus listening to that farewell
speech of Otho’s to the citizens, and taking irr the surmises of the
crowd whether or no the hand of Galerius Trachalus could be detected
in it (i. ily-90).

Of another event narrated in the First Book, the scene of which
is laid in Rome-the military dmeute described in cc 80-86-
Tacitus cannot himself, except in part, have been from the nature of
the case arr eyewitness It will be well therefore to reserve what we
have to say upon it till we come to consider the next head.

The thread of the narrative through the greater part of the Second
and Third Books takes us away from Rome, but there occur in them
three or four remarkable descriptions, the vividness of which seem to
betoken the pen of arr eye-witness. The first of these is the account
of Vitellius’s triumphal entry into the city at the head of his victorious
troops As we read Tacitus’s narrative the whole picture seems to pass
before our eyes. The shaggy soldiers frorn the wilds of Germany,
clothed in their dresses of skin arrd brandishing their huge weapons,
who were the advanced guard of the army, and spread no little con-
sternation among the citizens as they resented being jostled by the
crowd or falling on the slippery pavement (ii. 88) ; the Emperor Vitellius
himself advancing from the Milvian bridge mountedpn his splendid
charger, clad in his military coat and suit of armour, driving before him
senate arrd people, but persuaded by the solicitations of his friends to
halt at the Porta Carmentalis and don the toga praetexta that he might
not seem to be making his entry into a conquered city; the long line
of the troops behind him headed by the eagles of four legions and the
colours of the maniples of as many others; behind them the standards
of twelve troops of horse, and then the cavalry themselves following the
long lines of the infantry; after these the four and thirty cohorts of the
allies marshalled according to the races from which they carne or the
character of the arms they wore; the praefects of the camps, the
tribunes, arrd the leading centurions all clad in white, marching in
'front of the eagles, and the rest of the centurions each heading his own
oentury3 the glitter of the arms, the splendour of the trappings and
bracelets and orders-all this Tacitushad seen and noted. lle had
encountered also the German soldiery in the city, and had seen their

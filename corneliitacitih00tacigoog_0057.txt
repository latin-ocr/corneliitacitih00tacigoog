practioally unmolested, tbe Romans contenting themselves with keeping
up a connection with the royal house which ruled in Camulodunum.
But the Druids of Britain continued to be a source of disaffection ιο
the Celtic tribes of North-Westem France, and Claudius consequently
resolved upon the conquest of the distant island Aulus Plautius was
in the year 43 ab. despatched at tbe head of four legions to effect its
subjugation. In a single campaign he succeeded in over-running the
country as far as the Thames, and was then joined by Claudius himself.
The· two together annexed in spite of the resistance of Caractacus the
whole southern and eastern district up to the Humber. Trade and colon·
isation followed speedily on the heels of conquest 3 Roman merchants
penetrated everywhere, and within the next four years the Roman colonias
of Camulodunum (Colchester), intended as the capital of the country,
Londinium (London), Verulamium (St. Albana), and Aquae Salis (Bath)
were already founded The four legions which had been employed in
the conquest of the country remained as its permanent garrison, and
were sufficient to retain what had been already won and to make fresh
acquisitions as opportunity arose. Wales, however, botb north and
south, remained unsubdued, and to guard against danger from this
quarter the oamps of three out of the four legions were established in
its immediate neighbourhood-that of the 14th at Viroconium (wrox-
eter), ln the valley of the Severn near Shrewsbury; that of the and
at Isca (Caerleon), in the valley of the Usk; that of the aoth at Deva
(chester), in the valley of the Dee. Eigbt years before our present
date a great crisis had occurred. Suetonius Paulinus, appointed
governor by Nero, had resolved ou conquering North Wales and root·

He had taken with him the majority of the Roman troops quartered
in Britain, and after severe fighting had succeeded at last in effecting
his object But the Britons, headed by Boadicea, Queen of the Iceni in
Norfolk, who had suffered grievous wrong at the hands of Nero, seized
the opportunity of the absence of the legions in this remote comer of the
kingdom ιο rise in concerted revolt, and determined to rid themselves of
styranny which seemed ιο them no longer tolerable. Camulodunum was
besieged and taken, and all the Romans in it put to the sword The
same fate befel those in London and St Albana Petilius Cerialis, the
general who took so prominent a part afterwards iu the suppression of
the revolt of Civilis, hastening up from Lincolnsbire ιο the rescue of
Camulodunum with the 9th legion, was defeated and lost all his infantry.
Paulinus himself narrowly escaped a similar fate As he hurried back
from Wales hewasencountered by the whole body of the insurgenta The
valour and steadiness of the 14th legioh and of their Batavian auxiliaries
secured the victory for the Romans against great odds, and enabled them
ιο retain their hold of a country which had almost passed out of their
grasp. Queen Boadicea in despair killed herself by taking poison.
The Romans did not aller the suppression of the rebellion push forward

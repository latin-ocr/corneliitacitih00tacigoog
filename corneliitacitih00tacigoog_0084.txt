year. In 33 no. he was advanced to the consulship, succeeding in
that office curiously enough L Domitius, the father of the emperor Nero,
and himself succeeded in it by Salvius Otho, father of ‘Otho the future
emperor. By Caius he was selected to succeed Lentulus Gaetulicus
as commander in Upper Germany, 40 nm, and managed by vell-
timed severity to reestablish discipline which had been relaxed by the
ambitious leniency of his scheming predecessor (Ann vi 30). The
incursions too of the German tribm into the province, which under
Gaetulicus's lax rule had become habituri, he stemly restrained, and so
approved himself and his army to'the young emperor that he and his
soldiers were singled out by him for signal marks of favour and special
rewards. On the news of Caius’s assassination reaching his province
he was urged by many of his friends to seiae the throne, and earned
the goodwill of Claudius by refusing to do so. He accompanied that
emperor on his expedition into Britain (Claudius deferring the expedition
for ten days to give Galba time to recover from a passing ailment), and
was afterwards appointed proconsul of Africa. This post again he
filled with hrmness and distinction, restoring, as before in Germany‚
that discipline to the army which it so sorely needed, and reestablishing
in the province that intemal peace and extemal security, to give it

selectedby the emperor to fill the post of governor of the Tarraco
nensis In his new province he exhibited at first the same qualities
of stemness, integrity, vigilance, and activity vhich had characterised
his earlier commandsy but wamed at length that his energetic adminis
tration was exciting the jealousy of Nero he sanir into apparent apathy
and sloth‚ anxious to avoid by these means a fate which otherwise
too surely awaited him

'ibe movement which carried Galba to the throne originated in no
sense with Galba himself ; his was scarcely the mind to conceive in his
old age so vast and so venturous a proJect ; in all the events which
followed he vas largely the victim of circumstances, guided rather by
the course of affairs than guiding it. The first impulse came from his
neighbour on the other side of the Pyrenees, Caius JuliusVindea Vindem,
arixious to deliver his country from the oppressive load of taxation under
which it groaned, and vell aware that he had no chance of making a
successful rising, unless he could enlist some great Roman name in his
cause, made overtures toGalba, apparently as one only among several lead·

a deaf ear to his proposals 3 but presently wamed that Nero had got

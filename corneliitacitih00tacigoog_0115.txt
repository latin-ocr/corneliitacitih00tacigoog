Yet tbe movement which bad brought about such results was in
spite 01 its apparent success irom first to last really wealc Ciyilis had
never made up his mind whether to throw himself on his German or
his Gallie allies. Gaui as a whole had no beart in the cause, 101 she
knew iuil well that were Rome driven 110111 the scene the vacant sceptre
would iall not to ber but to her German allies and neighbours 3 and
Rome's might was as yet unbroken and was sure, as soon as tbe ques·
tion 01 the succession was settled, to reassert itseli in ali its former
greatness

Fora briei period, however, Civilis and his allies were to be allowed
to assert their authority. The legions were ordered to evacuate their
ancient quarters, the camps at Mogontiacum and Vindonissa being
alone retained. The 16tb legion srorn Novesium, the 1st from Bonn,
were bidden in the first place to concentrate themselves at Trevea As
soon as they began to march the 11111 horror and absurdity 01 the posi-
tion in which they bad placed themselves seem to have been brought
home to them: one squadron 01 horse broke away on the march, and
aiter killing Longinus, tbe murderer 01 Vocula, took up its quarters
unbidden at Mainz. The legions pursued their way to Treves, but

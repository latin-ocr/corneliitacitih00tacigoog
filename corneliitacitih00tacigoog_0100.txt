for the battle When the leading columns of the Othonians came
opposite or nearly opposite the camp before Cremona, Valens, while
the legions were deploying into position, despatched a body of Batavian
horse to encounter them. These horsemen were, however, driven back
by the bravery of the Pannonian cavalry, and were only presented from
forcing their way into the camp of the Vitellians and spreading confusion
there by the steadiness of the rst legion (Italica), who drove them off
with drawn swords and forced them once again to tum upon the enemy.
After this partial success the efforts of the Othoniana were for a time
paralysed owing to a rumour which got abroad to the effect that
Vitellius’s army had deserted him. Many of the Othoniana in con-
sequence threw away their arms and attempted to fratemise with the
enemy. Being rudely repulsed they had to take once more to fighting,
but took to it with the less will because of the recent disappointment
and the suspicions which their conduct had given rise to among their
fellows. When the fighting began there was not, owing to the broken
and encumbered nature of the ground, much in the way of a regular
battle The two armies engaged one another in small bodies here and
there just as they found opportunity. Only between the rst legion
(Classica Adiutrix) on Otho’s side and the arst on the side of Vitellius
was there anything in the nature of a formal engagement The rst
legion, victorious at first, was ultimately defeated, though not till it had
inflicted serious losses on its antagonists. On the raised causeway there
was also a sharp conflict, though who took part in it is not stated, the com·
batants there fighting as in the sight of either army and as if the whole
issue of the contest depended on them. Caecina had not been present
at the commencement of the light, but was hastily summoned from super·—
vising the construction of the bridge when the leading columns of the
enemy's force made their appearance. The final issue of the battle
seems to have been determined hya fiank attack from some Batavian
horse under the command of Alfenius Varus. These, after disposing of
a band of gladiators who had attempted to effect a landing on the
northern bank, charged the flank of the enemy ς and as when this hap
pened the centre had already been broken by its opponente, the whole
Othonian force was soon in full retreat making for the camp four miles
this side of Bedriacum. It was a long and dreary way, and many in
the course of it fell victims to· the rage of their pursuers, no quarter¹
being given in civil wara The generals fled even faster than the
soldiers, and Paulinus and Proculus seem never to have drawn rein till,
giving a wide berth to the camp, they reached Bedriacum itself. Less

fortunate were some of their colleagues. Vedius Aquila, legate of the '

13th legion, was almost tom in pieces by the angry troops ς while
Titianus, and Celsus were only saved by the skill and authority of
Annius Gallus. The troops either rightly or wrongly set down their
defeat to the half-heartedness of their leaders or their downright
treachery, and perhaps they were not altogether mistaken The

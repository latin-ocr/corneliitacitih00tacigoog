28 THE HISTORIES OF TACITUS sucu.

awhile its southern coast. Cluvius despatched for the defence of the
threatened district the newly-returned 6th legion from his own province
of Tarraconensia Albinus, however, alienated his troops by setting
up claims, or being supposed to set up claims, to the position of
an independent poteritate His most trusted subordinates were seized
and put to death by their own troops, and Albinus was himself slain
shortly afterwards. Soon after this, as Vitellius was advancing through
Gaul, Cluvius Rufus left his own provinceand hastened to meet him
at Lyons. The new emperor retained him among his retinue, and
. took him with him to Rome, allowing him to govern from a distance
the province of which he did not deprive him. Perhaps Vitellius,
though he had refused to listen to the charges brought against him by
the freedman Hilarius, may have thought there was sufficient in them
to make it safer to remove Cluvius from a country where he had suc·
ceeded in winning not a little popularity and goodwill Spain, which
had given one emperor to Rome, might wish to try if she could not
give a second. So Cluvius, while Vitellius reigned, govemed Spain
from the capital Meanwhile the rst legion (Adiutrix) was sent oli into
Spain, partly to replace the 4th legion (Macedonica) which had now
been regularly incorporated in the army-of Germany, partly that it
might unleam in a more quiet district the lessons of turbulence which
it had been taught in the midst oi the Civil War in Italy. Neither the
legions nor the people of Spain took any direct or active part in the
conflict between Vitellius and Vespasian. When Vitellius found him·
self threatened by the advance of the Pannonianand Moesian legions
he sent to Spain for reinforcements; but the country after the removal
of Cluvius Rufus was without a governor, and none of the legates of
the legions cared to put themselves forward in Vitellius’s behalf (it 86).
Their sympathies were probably already more with Antonius Primus
and the Flavians, from whom they had received letters inviting their
cooperation. So immediately after Antonius's victory at Bedriacum
’ and the surrender of Valens, Spain, following the lead of the rst
legion (Adiutrix), declared unhesitatingly for Vespasian (iii 44). We
hear after this of the country only once again, when two out of its three
legions were summoned away to enable Cerialis to make head against
the revolt of Civilis (iv. 68, v. 14).

The two western provinces of Northem Africa were closely associated
with the province of Baetica, being related to it, as Mommsen says,
something in the same way as Noricum to Pannonia or Raetia to
Upper Germany. This district had been a comparatively late acquisition
of the Romans During Caesar's vars in Africa it was still occupied
by independent princes-the eastern portion by Juba I., a descendant
of Masinissa, who sided with the Pompeians ; the western district by
Bogud and Bocchus, who took the side of Caesar. At the conclusion ·

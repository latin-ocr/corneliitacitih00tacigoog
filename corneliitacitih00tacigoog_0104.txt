from Bedriacum on the road to Cremona Here news is brought him
that the enemy are advancing, and Varus rushes oli with the most ener-

driven back, and would have been completely routed had not Antonius,
expecting what would happen, drawn up his forces in such a way as to
check the enemy and to provide a safe retreat for the routed cavalry.
Fora moment it looked as if the Vitellians might carry all before them,
and Antonius had to put forth all his nerve and energy to prevent the
spread of a panic among his troops. Fortunately the ground helped
him A ravine lay in his rear which rendered ssight difficult and forced
his troops to close up their ranks and to present an unbrolten front to
the fast-advancing enemy. These in their turn are thrown into confusion
by the unexpected obstacle3 they first waver‚ then break, then begin to
retire The advanced guard of the legions consisted of the arst and
rst legions, which following up the success of the cavalry had advanced
as far as the fourth milestone from Cremona. At this point, however,
they sadly missed a commander, and found themselves ignorant alike
how to render effective support to their own men or how to check the
victorious advance of the enemy. Vipstanus Messalla, at the head of the
Moesian auxiliaries, threw himself impetuously on their hesitating ranks;
aod the Vitellians, feeling that they had Cremona near to llee unto,
moved off towards it in preference to prolonging what now appeared to
them to be an almost hopeless struggle. For that day at any rate An·
tonius had triumphed, and could wait in safety till reinforcements came
up to him from Bedriacum This they did before nightfall, and as soon
as they arrived they clamoured at once to be led against the disheart·

plunder, so Tacitus believes, buoyed the weary troops up, and the expec-
tation that the wealthy city would fall, almost without a struggle,·into
their hands Their general, however, refused to lead thern to a night
attack on an unknown and strongly fortified town3 the danger would, he
urged, be too great, and they must wait for morning before undertaking ¹
so hazardous a venture· The camp followers and the freshest of the
cavalry were sent baclr meanwhile to Bedriacum to bring up more
troops and the implements necessary for a siege Before night closed
in, reconnoiterers, sent on ahead, learnt from some of the enemy whom
they captured close under the walls of Cremona, that six legions, con·

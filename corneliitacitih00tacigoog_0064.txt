they were irom Italy, the Easteru Alps presenting no such barrier to
intercourse as that sumished hythe Westem Alps The result was
that this whole district was early and completely Latinised. Roman
merchants everywhere traversed it; Roman towns grew up in its midst.
At a later date it counted practically as a part oi Italy, and was
reckoned such in the arrangements lor the levy. Its sympathies in the
war oi 69 an. were just the opposite to those oi Raetia For Vitellius
it had no liking ; it threw itself heartily into the cause oi Vespasian
as soon as his generals appeared on the scene. lts troops were used
as a setoff to those oi Raetia at the time oi Antonius's advance (iii 5);
at a later date Sextilius Felix at the head oi the Norican militia malr-
iog bis way through Raetia contributed an important clement towards
the final suppression ol the revolt ol Civilis (iv. 70). Nor is there
any difficulty in explaining the divergence oi view between the two dis
triete As Tacitus says, these smaller provinces took their colour irom
the legions with which they were most closely associated ; the Pannonian
army dominated Noricum as naturally as the German armies controlled
Raetia

The three provinces oi Dalmatia, Pannonia, and Moesia were Ι
included under the name illyricum in the wider use ol that term
(Η i. 76). All three provinces, closely associated with one another,
received their organisation from Augustus along with the other frontier
provinces oi Italy; they all joined in the great Pannonian revolt which
marked the years 7 and 8 am. Between them they included all that
partos the Baikan Peninsula which lies north of Macedonia and Thrace,
together with all the district south oi the Danube which lay to the east oi
Noricum, sle. the greater part oi the Ballran States and oi Fastern Austria

(r) Dalmatia had been indeed long subject to Rome before the
time oi Augustus, but little progress had been made in civilising it or
even in repressing the piracy with which the upper part of the Adriatic
was infested. It was not till after the close of the Dalmatian insurrec-
tion in 9 ab. that the taslr oi subjugating the country and reducing it
to order was undertakes in good eamest. Hitherto the towns along
the east coast oi the Adriatic had ’ been Greek towns, such as
Epidamnus and Apollonia, but Augustus now founded a number oi
oolonies with Latin rights, Epidaurum (Ragusa), Narona, Salonae,
leden· Colonists, mainly dispossessed proprietors in Italy, were also
sent there to strengthen the Italian element, and gradually the whole
coast-line adopted the Latin -language and became Latinised. Inland
the Latinising did not extend very far—the natural configuration ol the

district. In 69 an. the process was going on, but was not completed.
Salonae was already a prospemus place, and, Burnum and Delminium,

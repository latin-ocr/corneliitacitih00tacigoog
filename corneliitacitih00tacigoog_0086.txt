to secure for himself the power which, if transferred to Galba, would
bring him little profit or advancement The praetorians, however,
refused to listen to his blandishments, closed the gates of their camp
against him, and when he tried to force his way in set upon him with
their swords and murdered him. These were services for which they
naturally enough expected to be requited Instead, not only was there

no mention of making good the magnificent promises held out to them ·

by Nymphidius, but ewen the more moderate donatiye paid to the
city troops when Claudius and Nero had been successively raised by
their consent to the throne, was in the present instance refused them;
and a saying of Galba which they looked upon as a reproach levelled
at themselves was bruited about among them to the effect “that the
emperor chose his soldiers and did not buy them.” Nor was this all,
perhaps it was not even the worst They recognised that one who had
been set upon the throne by legionary troops, and held his office in
virtue of a vote of the Senate, would inevitably regard them with far
other eyes than those with which emperors who had been raised to
power directly by their will looked at them; while' Galba’s dismissal of
some of tbe centurione who had been intimate with, or had been
promoted by Nymphidius, spread alarm amongst all, each considering
that bis turn might come next In such a condition of feeling it
scaroely needed the bribery of Salvius Otho to stit them to revolt

Nor were the population of Rome much better disposed to the
new emperor than the soldiery. The lower people had genuinely loved
Nero. They suffered little from his crimes and vices ς his youth, his
good looks, bis affability, his love of the garnes, of pomp, display, aad
magnificence, bad all commended him to thern In his place they
found a feeble, gouty old man, hardly lrnown to them by sight, whose
niggardliness soon passed almost into a by·word and a proverb, and
who did not care to conceal his contempt for those garnes and shows
which long use had made almost a necessary part of their daily life.
He had surruunded himself too with favourites who would not
allow him to call his soul his own, of whom fame spoke and spoke
justly as of ill repute Vinius, Laco, and Icelus would bave sufficed to
ruia by their vices even a popular emperor; to Galba they soon left
scarcely a chance Nor had his entry into the city been such as to
raise him in the people’s affection and esteem. The perhaps necessary
executions of Cingonius Varro, of Fonteius Capito, of Clodius Macer,
had filled men's minds with a certain horror, and when Galba ordered
his cavalry to charge into the unarmed classrbni', and had insisted
afterwards on decimating them, the people shuddered at the bluody
spectacla Ewen the' Senate and the upper classes the emperor had
managedin some degree to alienate. The execution without trial of
Petronius Turpilianus, by rank a consular, an unarmed and defenceless
old man, had given great and just offence. Galba’s subservience to
his three favourites, his schoolmasters, as they scoffiugly called thena

56 THE HISTORIES OF TACITUS secr.

deities Under these circumstances it was not surprising that the
Syrians produced little of excellence in literature (though some of
their orators were famous), and were iooked upon rather as acorrupting
force than an ennobling element in the Roman world.

The seat of govemment and the chief headquarters of the troops
was at Antioch on the Orontes, near the north-west extremity of
the province Antioch owed its foundation to 'one of the Seleucid
princes, Seleucus Nicanor. After the Roman occupation of the
country it had prospered so much that it now reckoned as the
third greatest city of the Empire‚ coming. only after Rome itself
and Alexandria It was a city of great extent and of much natural
beauty; its suburb Daphne, aster which it was sometimes named
Epidaphnes, was reckoncd the finest park and pleasureground in the
world· It possessed an abundant and beautiful water-supply such
as no other ancient city could boast. Its chief street was four and a
half miles long, with a covered colonnade on either side and a broad
carriageway in the middle. Its public buildings were unusually linc
and stately, and the whole environs of the city were filled with the
villas of rich merchants and well-todo professional men. It was not

situated for the purpose, but those who had made their wealth in trade
elsewhere flocked to Antioch to spend in its pleasures the wealth they
had amassed Its population, partly Greek, partly native Syrian, partly
, Jewish, partly Roman, vas industrious and quickwitted, but pleasure-
loving, satirical‚ turbulent, and vicious in no ordinary degree The
Romans regarded it as the most debased and the most demoralising
population in the whole Empire‚ and they were probably not mistaken.

The province generally was rich in agricultural resources, rich too in
manufactures The soil, then everywhere well irrigated aad carefully
cultivated, brought forth in abundante fruit's of all kinds-vines, olives,
and wheat. All these things the country exported Among its manu·
factures were linen, purple, silk, and glass The Syrian merchants who
dealed in these goods frequented every coast of the Mediterranean and
established themselves in separate quarters at Ostia and Puteoli3 when
they had made their fortunes they constantly returned home It vas their
presence which made Antioch the home of luxury and elegance which
it had at this time become. Next to Antioch, Apamea, higher up the
Orontes, was the chief seat of Syrian wealth, and an even greater seat
of Syrian trade The merchants of Apamea outdid those of Antioch
itself in energy and enterprise. Other important cities were Tripolis,
Berytus, Anthemusias, Bambyce, Epiphaneia Syria, besides producing
manufactures of its own, still continued to be the emporium for the
goods of lower Mesopotamia and the· Persian Gulf. These came to
the Syrian ports in caravans across the desert, and the transmissit-m of
these foreign wares, while it tended to keep up the standaiduh the-

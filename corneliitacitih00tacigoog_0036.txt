same in general purport‚ from that to be found in Plutarch, that we
must either suppose that our author gave it a colouring of his own or
else that he had received a different version of it. The account of the
dangers encountered by the senators after Otho's death (cc 5²5 5)
may well have reached Tacitus from one of their number. Many of
the events which follow would be found recorded in official documents;
but Vitellius's visit to the field of Bedriacum was just one of those
incidents which court scandal delighted to make the most of, and
Tacitus has shown a wise discretion in omitting with reference to it
many loathsome details which Suetonius has been anxious according
tobis usual custorn to treasure up and retail. .

At the end of Book II we have mention of authors who related in
the times of the rnle of the Flavii the history of the Civil War. Who
these were we shall have to consider at length in the next section. It
was from thern that Tacitus probably derived most of his review of
affairs in the East But here again there would have been officers
who, serving under Vespasian, must have been able in many particulam
to supplement these written narratives; and of such information our
historian was sure to avail himself. Perhaps it was from this source
that he obtained a sketcb of the speech in which Mucianus pressed
Vespasian to seiae the crown, though tbe elaborate care with which the
speech is constructed seems also to testify to Tacitus’s own handiwork
in the making of it

In the Third Book the graphio picture of the manoeuvres culminating
in the second battle of Bedriacum was probably taken from the account
which Vi tanus Messalla, himself actively engaged in them, left behind
him; so too was the siff more striking account of the storm and sack ,
of Cremona (cc 26-34), though the genios of Tacitus imported to the
latter narrative a formali his own The story of the death of Junius
Blaesus our author seems directly to imply (c 38) was based upon
reports which were still widely prevalent when be was collecting his
information or writing about it For the events which followed the fall
of Cremona he cites incidentally celeberrimi auctores, without, however,
mentioning any names (c. 51). It was to thern that he was perhaps ,
indebted for the striking scene of the sunender of the greater part of
Vitellius's army before Narnia (c 63). Most of the events detailed in
the remainder of the book must have fallen under Tacitus’s per·
sonal observation, and need not, witb one exception, in the present
connection be further treated of. The closing soenes of Vitellius's life
Tacitus can scarcely himself have witnessed Its outlines must have
been matter of common notoriety3 but the differences in detail between
the aooounts of Tacitus, Dio, and Suetonius, testify to the varying
recollections or opportunities of those who were present on the occa-
sion arid told the tale of maltreatment and ignominy.

The transactions and debates in the Senate, which take upa good
deal of the earlier part of Book IV, might be gathered from the “ Acta ’'

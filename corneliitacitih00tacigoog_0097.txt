ta THE HISTORIES OF TACITUS secr.

Othonian leaders, however, were not thus to be caught napping.
Informed ol his designs they detennined to counter·work them and to
catch Caecina himself in the trap which he had laid for them. The
‘disposition which they made of their troops was as follows. On the
left, ie. on the river side of the Postumiam rond, was stationed a
detachment of the 13th legion, being part of that force of the
. Pannonian army which had been sent on in advance. With this there
stood four cohorts of auxiliaries and five hundred cavalry belonging
probably to the same force. The causeway itself was occupied by three
cohorts of praetorians, each one thousand strong] drawn up in deep
tiles, while on the right of the road, the side exposed to the llanlr
attaclr of the enemy, were the rst legion (Adiutrix), two auxiliary cohorts
and five hundred more cavalry3 behind and in reserve werea thousand
more picked horsemen The total force can hardly have fallen much
short of fifteen thousand men The order of the battle which followed,
though not very clearly described by Tacitus, would seem to have been
of the following kind The cavalry on the right wing advanced first, and
it was they who would seem to have drawn out the Vitellians from
their ambuscade. As they retired the Vitellians· followed thern, but
as the latter advanced they found their way barred by the two legions,
which as they moved forward seem to have closed in towards the
causeway in front of the praetorians who now acted merely as a reserve.
The auxiliary forces which had been stationed with the legions on the
wings continued* their advance and threatened the enemy on either
llanlc At the same time the reserve of cavalry stationed originally
behind the praetorians, dividing into two bodies, made their way round
either fianlr of their own force, and passing the enemy took them in
the rear, thus getting in between them and their camp. The Vitellians,
hard beset on all sides, were in imminent danger; and it was only the
cautious, perhaps even the treacherous, delay of Paulinus which gave
them 'time to seek refuge in some woody ground in their rear, where
they were comparatively safe from the attack of the cavalry. When
Otho’s infantry at last advanced the line of the enemy was at once
broken and driven in ssight, a flight so precipitate that the supports sent
forward from the camp by Caecina were quite unable to stay it, and
themselves had to taire part in a movement they were powerless to
resist The general belief on both sides was that had Paulinus pressed
on at once instead of indulgiug in overcautious or treacherous delays,
the enemy's camp would undoubtedly have fallen into his hands and
their whole force been scattered or annihilated
Immediately after the battle Valens with his fresh troops carne up
from Ticinum to Caecina’s support His army was considerably more
numerous than that of his colleague, and the combined forces of both
armies cannot have fallen much short of one hundred thousand men
Both armies when united entrenched themselves in a fortified camp
just outside the walls of Cremona.

18 THE HISTORIES OF TA CITUS sacr.

of that body. But the details given are often of a kind which would
certainly be omitted from the official register of the procoedings
and for them Tacitus must have been indebted to the reports of
his friends How else could he have known, for instance, the remarks
to which the receipt 01 Mucianus's letter gave rise (c. 4), 0101110 im·
pressiori which Domitian's blushes produced when first he appeared
in that body (c 4ο), or the contrast in the mien of Vibius Crispus
and of Marcellus Eprius (c 43)? ‘ibe speeches, again, actually
delivered, or the more important of them, were published by their
authors or hecanm at any rate commonplaces in the schools of
rhetoric 1t is thus that in the Dialogus (c 5) our author refers to
Eprius Marcellus’s defence against the attaclc made upon him by
Helvidius Priscus (iv. 7, 8). Vipstanus Messalla's defence 01 his
brother Aquilius Regulus, and Montanus’s attack upon him, perhaps,
come under the same category (cc 42, 4 3).

From what quarters Tacitus drew the materials for his careful and
minute account of the revolt of Civilis ve shall never know. He makes
no single reference to his authorities during the course of it lt may be
that Pliny the elder included the story of the war in those twenty volumes
on ‘⁶ all the wars that were ever waged with the Germaus ” (Suet. ed. Roth.
p. 300), awork which his nephew tells us (Eppiii 5, 4) he undertookwhilc
still fightinginGermany‚ prompted thereto byadream The exhaustive
character 01 the work makes it probable that some account of the revolt
of Civilis, in which the Germana were so mixed up, was contained in
it; and if so, since we know from Ann. i. 69 that Tacitus was acquainted
with and made use of the book, it is very likely that in the present
instance he would also have drawn upon it. That he did not, however,
restrict himself to this one authority is certain frorn the careful study
which the Germania proves he had made of all German affairs We
have already noticed that there is some ground for believing that he
had himself conducted investigations on the spot, and among his
investigations it is certain he would not neglect inquiries from those
who as otlicers or as men had taken part in these events, many of whom
he must have met shortly after their return from the war, as he grew up
from youth to manhood Among his informants we may with sorne
probability reckon the celebrated writer on Tactics and on Roman
Aqueducts—Frontinus, mentioned in iv. 39 as praetor urbanus, who
(Strat iv. 3, 14) tells us that he was engaged in the war against Civilis
and took over 70,000 men surrendered to him by the state 01 the
Lingones. To this same source, the reports 01 those who had taken

part in the war, we shall probably not be wrong in considering that he
was indebted (so far as itis not derived from Pliny's Natural Ir'istoty)
for the materials for the remarkable description 01 the physical features
01 Judaea which he has introduced in the earlier part 01 Book V, for
there seems no reason to believe that he had ever himself actually
visited the country. Whencc he drew his account of the antiquities

The revolt oi Civilis is, perhaps, the most remarkable and note·
worthy oi the events recorded in these books os the Hr'ston'es. It ¹
contains a lrind os prophecy oi the doom that was to beiall the Roman
Empire‚ the doorn oi being destroyed by its own nominal desenders
But Rome in spite os its crimes, its divisions and uncertainties, had
still the root oi its grsatness in it; its doom was not yet; and as soon
as it could put forth even a part oi its strength the revolt collapsed lile
a paclr oi cards, Gaul returned almost without a struggle to its allegiance,
and Civilis himself at the end oi a few weeks had become a hunted
ι fugitive seelring to male peace on such terms as he could with his
conquerors The dream oi an empire oi the Gauls north oi the Alps
which should be the counterpart of the Roman Empire south oi the
Alps had passed hopelessly away, no more to be renewed for many
Α generations to come. Yet it is important to notice how, even at this
early date, Rome had already exercisedthat spell over her would-be
conquerors which she so decisively exerted later on over her actual
invaders lt was alreadya Roman empire oi their own, not something
different from the Roman Empire‚ which the Gauls and the Germana
aspired to establish. They sought nothing more, but they dreamed
oi nothing less, than to be the inheritors oi Rome’s organisation, great·
ness‚ and glory. The dream was, as we shall see, not iulfilled at this
time or nearly iulhlled3 and when centuries later the iulfilment came
it was not to the Celts that Rome’s seeptre passed, but to those Teutonic
races who, coming from the other side of the Rhine, iumished even
now the most trustworthy and sormidable element in that motley host
who in the crisis os Rome's division and weakness seemed to threaten
ior a moment her still deeply·rooted supremacy.

Therevolt os Civilis was one of those many events in history which ·
have arisen partly out oi general, partly out oi personal and accidental
causes The general causes in such cases lay the train, and the per·
sonal causes are, so to speak, the spark that tires it. The general causes
which brought about the revolt were the disorganisation of the empire,
consequent on a disputed succession to the throne, and the demorali·
sation in the armies, and relaxation os discipline which the disputed
succession and civil vars had produced as their natural result. Such a
state o( things could scarcely fail to prompt some oi the neighbouring
nations to try conclusions with the conquerors oi the world, and the
Germans seized eagerly on the opportunity offered them to pay off some
oi their scores against their ancient and hereditary ioes. What was

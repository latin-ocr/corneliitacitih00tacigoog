ts THE HISTORIES OF TACITUS stet.

from the praetoriam who had apparently volunteered to reenlist, and
an immense number, so Tacitus describes them, of volunteers ἱῐοω
the lieet (H. ii 11).

Vitellius’s forces also consisted cf two divisions Τὴο first cf them
was the army cf Caecina, drawn mainly from the forces of, Upper
Germany-the backbone cf the whole being the arst legion, previously
stationed at Vindonissa—which had advanced into Italy by way cf
Switzerland and the Great St Bemard It had been iocreased by the
adhesion to it of the ala Siliana which, revolting to Vitellius sc soon
as the troops had begun their march southward, had placed him at
once in possession of the whole plain of Northern Italy, including the
four strong cities of Mediolanum,Vercellae, Eporedia, and Novaria (i 7ο)
To assist them in holding these and generally in maintaining the dis
trict north of the Po, Caecina, while himself still encamped north cf the
Alps, had sent cn in advance a considerable body of Gauls, Lusi·
mouns, Britons, and Germans, together with a squadrcn cf auxiliary
horse. As soon as the spring came, he followed them himself, as
quickly as he could, with his main army, crossing, while the snow was
still deep, the pass of the Great St. Bemard, which, starting hom the
Rhone valley near Martigny, brought him down tc Aosta in the plain cf
lombardy. The other division, a larger force under the command cf
Valens, advanoed more leisurely, making its way through Gaul Valens
was at the head cf forty thousand men, drawn mainly from the legions
of lower Gennany. The sth legion held in his army the same com·
manding position which the arst held in that of Caecina As Valens
advanced through Gaul, he was joined by troops cf native auxiliaries
who flccked tc him from all the tribes which lay around his line cf
march. Of them, however, Tacitus himself makes but little account.
In addition to them he took away with him from Lyons the ast legion
(Italica), stationed there as the permanent garrison of the place, and
asquadrcn cf horse, the ala Tauriana These two together made an
important reinforcement to the division under his command Valens
advanced by way cf the Graian Alps, the most frequented at this ume
of all the passes into Italy, over which Pompey had made a military
road Arrived in Lombardy be pitched his camp at Ticinum, being
apparently at this time in nc great burry tc effect a juncticn with his
colleague (i. 66). , ¹

The first slight advantage was wcn hythe army cf Caecina As his
vanguard advanced towards th'e Po it succeeded in surprising and cap
turinga cohort of Pannonians near Cremona, and one hundred cavalry
and a thousand classici farther west near Ticinum, between that place
and Placentia Some of the Batavian auxiliaries even made good the
passage of the Po at this point, spreading no small consternation among
their opponents who thought that the whole of Caecina's army was upon
thern (ii. 17). Spurinna was at that dme holding Placentia, south of the
Po, for Otho. His troops, on receiptcf the news that the enemy had

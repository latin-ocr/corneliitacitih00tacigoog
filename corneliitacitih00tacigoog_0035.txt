16 THE HISTORIES OF TA CITUS secr.

dependent accounts oi eye-witnesses it is, in the absence oi the docu-
ments he consulted, hard to determine It is at least probable that he
often supplemented the written accounts he used by information derived
from personal inquiry. That he made use of this source ol information
is clear from Pliny’s letters. The account which Pliny hasgiven in
the'm of the eruption of Vesuvius was clearly iumished by him in answer
to a request ol Tacitus ior a first-hand report ol what he had actually
witnessed, and there can be no reasonable doubt that Tacitus sought the
information lor the purposes ol his History (Plin Epp. vi. 16 and ao).
What he did in this instance he certainly must have done in other cases
also. But these more or less casual pieces oi information it is impos
sible ior us now to detect. All that can be done is to indicate the
main narratives which were probably derived from this source

Galba's address to Piso, but this is not very likely3 it is more probable

Further on, Otho’s joy when the head oi his rival Piso was brought to
him is expressly mentioned on hearsay evidence (“ nullam caedem
excepisse-dicitur,” i 44).

The account ol the revolt which, beginning with the 17th cohort
stationed at Ostia, spread to the praetorian troops and was almost the
destruction oi the city, is told with so much spirit that it would seem
to have been communicated by one oi the guests present at the banquet
into which the unmly soldiery burst From'the same source may have
been derived the report of the speech with which on the next day Otho
attempted to allay the turbulence of the raging guarda and to quiet the
fears ol the alarmed senators (cc 83, 84).

Early in the Second Book there occurs a little episode which we
are able with much probability to trace to its source The invasion
by Otho's troops ol the district ol the Maritime Alps was witnessed
by many with whom Tacitus must have had a chance ol convers-
ing. Agricola's mother was lrilled in that attach upon Albintimilium
which he records (c 13), and his own wife or her attendants may well
have recollected the details oi an event which affected them so nearly.
For the outline ol the operations which took place in the valley ot the
Po, by which Otho's iate was determined, Tacitus seems mainly to have
relied on the published accounts of the military authorities, though he
exercised an independent judgment in selecting between the different
versions oi the events which came before him ; but the speech which he
puts into Otho’s mouth on his deathbed differs so much, though the

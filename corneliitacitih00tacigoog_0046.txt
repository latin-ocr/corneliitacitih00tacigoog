by the Romans a remote and dismal country. Otho complains ol his
eniorced residence there as banishment. Yet there were a number of
Roman and Latin colonica-Olisipo (Lisbon), Pax Julia (Beja), and
the capital Emerita Augusta (Medda), being the chief—established in
this district, and here as elsewhere the Latin language had taken the
place ol the earlier Spanish dialects

In the events ol 69 an). Spain plays an important part. Galba,
when invited' by Vindex to place himself at the head ol the revolt
against Nero, had been already at the head oi the province of Tarraco
nensis lor eight years. He had govemed it with stemness, but justly
and uprightly, and had tried even to limit the cruelties which Nero had
ordered or encouraged So when the lact became known that Vindex
had invited him to place himself at the head ol the insurrectionary
movement and to assume the purple, Romans and provinciale alike
llocked to his standard and joined in proclaiming him emperor. The
most energetic ol those who thus supported him was Lucius Salvius
Otho, governor ol the neighbouring province os Lusitania Otho
supplied him with the necessary appliances lor keeping up the splendour
os a court Altera brief period ol uncertainty and hesitation, a
hesitation caused by the news of the ill-success ol Vindex's rising,
Galba, seeing it was too late to retire, determined to make the venture,
aud when the tidings oi Nero’s death reached him, set out, at the head
cf the {2¹¹¹ legion and accompanied 'by Otho, for Rome. At Narbo he
was met by a deputation from the Senate‚ and received at their hands
what he had previously declined when offered him by the officials oi
his province and the provinciale alone-the title oi emperor. Alter
the departure ol Galba and Otho, Cluvius ¹Rufus became the governor
os the Tarraconensis. He is described by Tacitus as an eloquent
writer, but a man oi peace, unskilled in the arts ol war. As soon as
Otho ascended the throne Spain at once gave in its adherence to him,
and Cluvius Rufus was praised lor the promptitude with which he had
acted Α lew days later, however, a second message reached Rome to
’ the effect that the Spaniards had changed their mind, and that Vitellius
and not Otho was now their favourite (i. 76). Otho attempted to
regain their goodwill by bestowing privileges and benefits on the
different states. Il Spain was won over by these measures and wished
to support him she soon lost her opportunity. Τὴε battle oi Bedri-
acum scaled Otho’s sate, and alter it she had no other choice than to
throw in her lot with the other western states and declare lor Vitellius.
This was made all the easier lor her because Otho, naturally enough

in demptum-which was fought out on the lields oi Northern
Italy. It looked sor a moment alter Bedriacum as il the loyalty of
Spain to Vitellius was to be put to a severe test Lucceius Albinus,
governor ol Mauretania, a devoted follower ol Otho, threatened lor

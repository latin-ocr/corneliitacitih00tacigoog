oi the war the victorious Caesar added to the dominions ol his allies
the kingdom ol Juba, creating Cirta, however, into a free Roman town.
By Augustus the kingdoms both oi Bogud and ol Bocchus were
handed over to Juba 11 (son oi Juba 1.), who had been brought up in
Rome and had married Salene, or Cleopatra, daughter oi Antony and
the Egyptian queen (Ann. iv. 5). Juba was succeeded about 23 nn.
by his son Ptolemaeus. In the year 40 ab. Caius summoned this
unfortunate prince to Rome, had him executed, and took over his
dominions into imperial administration Two years later the Gaetulians
rose in revolt, but were soon reduced to subjection by Suetonius
Paulinus, Otho's well-known general, who was the lirst Roman to cross
the chain of the Atlas. The annexed district Caius (or Claudius, ac-
cording to Dio) constituted into two provinces, both caesariam both
govemed by a procurator, the eastern being known by the name of Maure-
tania Caesariensis, the western as Mauretania Tingitana Oi the lirst
the capital was Iol or Caesarea3 oi the second Tingis, situated just
outside the Straits ol Gibraltar. The two districts were somewhat
separated from one another, there being no road connecting the two, so
communication had to be kept up along the inhospitable coast by sea.
It was while making the voyage from Tingis to Caesarea that the above
mentioned procurator, Lucceius Albinus, was killed (H.·ii. 59). The
general physical characteristics ol the two provinces arethe same; each
consists ol a double mountain range, the northern one closely bordering
on the Mediterranean Sea, while the southern one slopes away into the
great Sahara, and ol a deep depression between them This depression
consists oi desert and salt lakes, intersper'sed with fertile oases and rich
river valleya I'n the eastern district there grew up a considerable number
ol Roman towns and colonies3 in the western hardly any. In neither
district did the Romans keep any permanent soree os their own, but
the native militia consisted, according to Tacitus (ii. 58), os nineteen
cohorts and live alae, computed by Mommsen to amount to fiileen
thousand men The Moorish cavalry osten served at a distance from
home among the widespread armies ol the Roman empire.

The forces ol the Mauretanias were notos a kind to exercise any
decisive influenoe on the fortunas oi the war (i. 11). Except sor Al-
binus’s sutile effort to create a diversion in favour oi the Othonian
· cause we hear nothing of thern. They kept their Spanish neighbours
in a state oi disquietude, and that was all.

-Gaul and Spain are described by Antonius Primus as‘ ‘validissimam
terrarum partem’' (iii 53); and Josephus writing in the time oi
Vespasian says, “In Gaul the sources ol wealth are at home and flood
the earth with their abundance.’' Cerialis (iv. 74) describes its soil as
most productive, and contrasts 'it with the swamps and deserte oi

·Germany. Thriving towns were soattered everywhere throughout its

Ι 70 THE HISTORIES OF TA CITUS sucu.

Tacitus 'to 'have' worlred well, 'and was 'adopted by Vitellius assoon
as he ascended the throne It became afterwards a settled rule of
the service. Tacitus indeed finds great fault with him for leaving to
the praetoriam the choice of their own ‚commanders Such a course
was, no doubt, opposed to all the traditions of Roman discipline, but it
provided at any rate the soldiers with commanders whom they could
trust, and one at least of whom remained faithful to Otho till his latest
breath With the execution of Tigellinus, the worst probably ο1 all
Nero’s creatores, which was Otho's next public act, Tacitus could in
accordance with his own principles find no direct fault3 he might have
admitted that Otho in ordering it showed nerve in which Galba had
failed, and in Otho, who counted himself as one ο1 Nero’s entouroga
it required more uerve than it would bave required iu Galba. If -in
the case of Calvia Crispinilla, whom public opinion also marked out
for vengeance, he sbowed less tirmness, this may be excused by the
consideration that she had now a powerful husband to defend her, and
Otho, even more than his successors, may have felt that his position
was not sufficiently established to allow him to incur needlessly power-
ful enmities3 and, after all, Crispinilla's crimes were not, so far as we
know, ofa kind to put her at all on a level with Tigellinus She was
bated by the populace becausesbe was supposed to have attempted in
Nero’s interests to starve them by cutting off the African com-supplies
(i. 73). The next charge which Tacitus has to bring against Otho
is that of undue haste in the allotment of offices, and of precipitancy
in restoring to dignity and position, either in their own person or in
that of their descendants, not only those who had unjustly suffered
under previous emperors but also those who had been punished for real
crimes. Such want of cautiori on the emperors part is indeed to be
regretted ς yet it does not look at any rate like an undue treading in
Nero's steps, and Tacitus does not deny that the reparation made
wasia many‘cases just and desirable. Respecting Tacitus's next
ground of complaint against Otbo it is difficolt to spealt with cer·
tainty. Tacitus says that he bestowed with illconsidered profusion
gifts and privileges to the allies and the provinces. Spain, on which most
of these favours were bestowed, was at the moment wavering between
his cause and tbat oi his opponent, it need scarcely surprise us, there
soreii be did his best to win it over to his allegiance, and after all
who was the loser by what Spain gained? Such acts as this are the
almost necessary devices of one who finds himself still insecurely seated
on his throne If they do as little barm as Otho’s seem to have done
to his country or to individuale, we readily forgive tbem. Tbe notiou
' that he was willing to talre the name of “ Nero Otho ’' to win tbe favour
of the lowest populace we might, perhaps, dismiss as a fabrication of
his enemies, did not Cluvius Rufus also seem to attest it Yet even here
we have no proof that Otho ever carried his supposed intention into
effect The next recorded episode, that ο1 the outbrealr of the prae·
